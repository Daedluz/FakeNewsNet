Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after. And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator. But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad. That's the secondary issue.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/elections/2020/icons/election-icon-40-section-front.svg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/12/2015-12-20T013928Z_01_MAN509_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/12/2015-12-20T013928Z_01_MAN509_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/19/3rd-democratic-debate-transcript-annotated-who-said-what-and-what-it-meant/", "title": "3rd Democratic debate transcript, annotated: Who said what and what it meant", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/19/3rd-democratic-debate-transcript-annotated-who-said-what-and-what-it-meant/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/12/2015-12-20T013928Z_01_MAN509_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION.jpg&w=1440", "title": "3rd Democratic debate transcript, annotated: Who said what and what it meant"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "3rd Democratic debate transcript, annotated: Who said what and what it meant"}, "last_updated_date": "2021-11-25T20:28:30.942Z", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T05:16:48.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-11-25T20:28:30.942Z", "section": "The Fix", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width", "next-head-count": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1450454400.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
