She captioned the Instagram shot, \"Stormi.\"\n\nKim Kardashian followed the photo up with a tweet of her own, confirming the name with a simple emoji:\n\nKylie and Travis Scott welcomed their baby girl at Cedars-Sinani in Los Angeles on Thursday, Feb. 1, the same hospital Kylie's nieces and nephews were born.\n\nAfter keeping her pregnancy completely under wraps for 9 months, Kylie confirmed the news on Sunday before the Super Bowl, calling it \"the most beautiful, empowering, and life changing experience I've had in my entire life.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Kylie, Twitter seems to think her baby's name sounds a bit like the name of the porn star President Donald Trump may or may not have paid to keep quiet, Stormy Daniels. Others are cracking jokes about a Kardahian/Jenner family's weather-releated names, writing things like, \"It's going to be Stormi, with a chance of Reign, in the North of Chicago.\"\n\nSee the most savage reactions to the news below:\n\nBig year for people named Stormi/Stormy pic.twitter.com/qg4ZFkmpdr @jtylerconway\n\nConspiracy Theory: Kylie had her baby last month before the Stormy Daniels story broke. She wouldn't name her baby after a porn star who publicly slept with Donald Trump. Right, guys?
