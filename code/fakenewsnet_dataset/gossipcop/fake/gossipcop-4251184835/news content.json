Picture: Chloe Lattanzi/Instagram Image originally from Kourtney Kardashian Snapchat\n\nKhloe previously declared she would never wear fur despite dropping her support for animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\nKhloe had been an ambassador for PETA and featured on billboards for the organisation.\n\nHowever she cut ties to the group in 2012, when she discovered they were linked to a woman who attacked Kim with a flour bomb.\n\nKhloe released a statement at the time.\n\n\u201cHi dolls. I\u2019m sure you all heard what happened to Kim last week (thank you SO much for the love and support you all showed her), and I just received word that the woman responsible has very close ties to PETA, despite PETA publicly stating otherwise,\u201d the statement read.\n\nKris Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, and Kourtney Kardashian pose as Khloe Kardashian unveils her PETA \"Fur? I'd Rather Go Naked\" billboard in 2008. Picture: Getty\n\n\u201cNot only has PETA lied to the public, but they have proved that they support this kind of behaviour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a vocal supporter of PETA for a long time but I have also been very vocal about anti-bullying, so this was a huge disappointment for me.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, I don\u2019t condone violence and bullying and what happened last Thursday was just that.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely disgusted by their behaviour. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions \u2014 I personally don\u2019t wear fur but that doesn\u2019t mean I am going to force my views on anyone else, ESPECIALLY by violating them.\n\nKim Kardashian is covered in flour during arrivals at the \"True Reflection\" Fragrance Launch at The London West Hollywood in 2012. Picture: Getty\n\n\u201cI am a very proud sister right now, because Kim handled last week\u2019s incident like a champ. She got cleaned up and was back out there in a matter of minutes. Go Kimmie!\n\n\u201cWe all need to practice what we preach. I will still continue to NOT wear fur, but I will no longer support PETA. Bullying and harassment is NEVER a solution, and I won\u2019t be a part of any organisation that thinks otherwise.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.news.com.au/wp-content/themes/newscorpau-news-dna/dist/images/logos/news.svg", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/98efcdbf77231ccb28a04aff100cc6aa", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3a79efefbc12cddb4914beb8d105faf3", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/cccf562a7f1a9b9fcb5a59fa7a1d4455", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c921eaf078c994a02be1e9a97baca3c5", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/01cb77d52727c344d2aef0ce98e3dac2"], "top_img": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/98efcdbf77231ccb28a04aff100cc6aa", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writers", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/kardashian-sisters-kim-khloe-and-kourtney-slammed-for-wearing-fur-coats/news-story/8860e2b9b77330a50133e135e8761d48", "title": "Kim Khloe Kourtney Kardashian slammed for \u2018wearing fur\u2019", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "robots": "noarchive", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "application-name": "news", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "description": "THE Kardashians have been savaged for parading around in fur coats and posting pictures of it on social media.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1454481155, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/au/app/news-com-au/id1454481155", "fb": {"app_id": 113758722003364}, "keywords": "bombedKardashian fur backlash,Fur furore,script async,Khadijah Haqq McCray,United States of America,People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,blockquote class,North America,Cleveland,Custom HTML,Glamorous Workout Routine,Northern America,controversial fashion choice,tape dropping,America,Olivia Newton-John,Ohio,Staff writers,wearing fur,social media,Kim Kardashian,wearing fur coats,wear fur", "article": {"publisher": "news.com.au \u2014 Australia\u2019s leading news site", "author": "Staff writers", "publicationdate": "2017-04-12T01:32:00.000Z", "section": "News", "published_time": "2017-04-12T01:32:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-04-12T02:09:04.000Z"}, "ob": {"article_type": "NON_PREMIUM"}, "articleid": "8860e2b9b77330a50133e135e8761d48", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newscomauHQ", "title": "Kardashian pic causing massive uproar", "description": "<p>THE Kardashians have been savaged for parading around in fur coats and posting pictures of it on social media.</p>", "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/98efcdbf77231ccb28a04aff100cc6aa"}, "og": {"site_name": "news", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Kardashians slammed for \u2018wearing fur\u2019", "description": "THE Kardashians have been savaged for parading around in fur coats and posting pictures of it on social media.", "category": "News", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/kardashian-sisters-kim-khloe-and-kourtney-slammed-for-wearing-fur-coats/news-story/8860e2b9b77330a50133e135e8761d48", "image": {"identifier": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/98efcdbf77231ccb28a04aff100cc6aa", "width": 100, "height": 75}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/kardashian-sisters-kim-khloe-and-kourtney-slammed-for-wearing-fur-coats/news-story/8860e2b9b77330a50133e135e8761d48"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491960720.0, "source": "http://www.news.com.au", "summary": ""}
