If you look at their first statement it says divorce, not separate,\u201d a source told the magazine. \u201cThey just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.\u201d", "images":
