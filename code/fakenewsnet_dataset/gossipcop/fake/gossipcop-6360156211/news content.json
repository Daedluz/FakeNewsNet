But now a tabloid has claimed that the Wests \"barely made it this year\" and that Kim Kardashian said that herself. While the story could sound credible to some because of the drama that Kim and Kanye have been involved in this year, celebrity rumor watchdog, Gossip Cop, says that the story is untrue.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reports, OK! Magazine recently reported that Kim confessed that her and her husband's relationship almost didn't survive this year. They based their reporting on a tweet that Kim posted to celebrate Kanye's Birthday.\n\n\"Kim Kardashian Wishes Kanye A Happy Birthday \u2014 Says They Barely Made It This Year,\" one headline for the article declared. Another headline read, \"Marital Problems? Kim Kardashian Wishes Kanye A Happy Birthday \u2014 Hints They Barely Made It Through The Year.\"\n\nBut that's not what Kim tweeted at all. Here's what she said:\n\n\"Happy Birthday babe @kanyewest!!!!! It's been a wild year but we're here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams. You inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2S43UeRi0ZH1LVoOcLJg.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce-rumors-saint-north-chicago.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/SRkq7iaJjaAIxUG3qWmK.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/910X9PrrEXYdiMdDsi31.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/vVMNUJxvlG97hM1XoxV2.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/q2inidJL9OvuSt3yIJGR.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1yZ3ooVQGuSSqIu8Db1D.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce-rumors-saint-north-chicago.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4934020/kim-kardashian-never-said-she-and-kanye-west-barely-made-it-this-year-despite-report/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Never Said She And Kanye West 'Barely Made It' This Year, Despite 'OK!
