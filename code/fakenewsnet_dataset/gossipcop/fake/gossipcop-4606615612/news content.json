And since then, the Leftovers star has been pretty busy hunting for his new bae\u2014according to the media, at least.\n\nWith the end of a high-profile relationship like Jen and Justin\u2019s, rumors are par for the course, but the speculation surrounding Theroux is next level\u2014especially considering that his counterpart, Aniston, hasn\u2019t been romantically linked to anyone except for ex-husband Brad Pitt (and c\u2019mon guys, that\u2019s way too easy).\n\nSince announcing their split, Theroux has been linked to not one, but nine (9) different ladies (and one man), and surprise, surprise, most of the claims are ridiculous.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t had time to pore over each and every outlandish report, we\u2019ve done it for you. Behold, the complete history of Justin\u2019s rumored post-Jen dating life.\n\nLouis Vuitton 2019 Cruise Collection : Photocall Credit: Getty Images\n\nChloe Harstein\n\nNot two weeks post-split, rumors spread that Justin was dating his stylist Chloe Harstein. However, the rumors were just that: rumors. Theroux\u2019s reps confirmed to Gossip Cop that \u201cnothing is going on\u201d between the colleagues.\n\n\n\nAlexa Chung\n\nSoon after his and Jen\u2019s split, news broke that not only were he and Alexa Chung dating, but they were planning to have kids! Don\u2019t worry, this one got absolutely no traction after the initial reports.\n\n\n\nPetra Collins\n\nOne of the first, and perhaps the most viable of Theroux\u2019s rumored love interests, is 25-year-old Petra Collins. The Canadian artist/model/photographer and bestie to Selena Gomez (see below) has been spotted with the actor several times over the last few months, and even made a cameo on his Instagram feed just one week prior to his and Jen\u2019s announcement. Despite it all, sources insist Petra and Justin \u201care friends.\u201d\n\nAubrey Plaza\n\nThe Parks and Recreation star was spotted out with Theroux in late March, naturally sparking rumors of a romance. This particular strain of gossip died out quickly, though\u2014Plaza is reportedly still dating longtime boyfriend Jeff Baena, and a source told People that she and Justin only met to \u201cdiscuss a potential film project.\u201d Case closed.\n\n\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nLike Sel\u2019s pal Petra, she and Theroux are friends\u2014the kind that hang out in public and occasionally even crop up in each other\u2019s Instagram feeds. Questionable sources have maintained that Sel and the other Justin are \u201cfalling for each other,\u201d but we\u2019re really not getting that vibe. Plus, she and Jen Aniston go way back.\n\nEmma Stone\n\nLouis Vuitton : Front Row - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2018/2019 Credit: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images\n\nEveryone is working really hard to make Emma Stone and Justin Theroux happen. The pair co-star in Netflix\u2019s upcoming series Maniac and sometimes hang out in bathing suits/at exclusive after-parties, but Theroux is the first to admit that they\u2019re \u201cBffffffs. JUST bfffffs.\u201d (Plus, there are also rumors that Stone and her ex, Andrew Garfield, are heating up again.)\n\nJustin Theroux Embed Credit: Instagram/justintheroux\n\nLaura Harrier\n\nHarrier has also logged some swimsuit-clad hours with Theroux (in France, no less), but a source recently told Entertainment Tonight that he and the Spiderman star aren\u2019t an item\u2014in fact, he\u2019s not in a relationship at all. \u201cJustin is not in a relationship,\u201d they revealed. \u201cHe\u2019s super social and loves meeting new people and collaborating on ideas with friends. These days he\u2019s been spending time with friends and family.\u201d\n\nJonathan Van Ness\n\nVulture Festival Presented By AT&T - Milk Studios, Day 2 Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nDespite the flirty nature of the Queer Eye star\u2019s Insta story with Theroux and Stone, again, \u201cJUST bfffffs.\u201d\n\nOlivia Munn\n\nCelebrity Sightings at Comic Con In San Diego - July 21, 2017 Credit: SMXRF/Star Max/Getty Images\n\nInTouch received an \u201cinsider\u201d tip that Theroux had been \u201cleaning on Olivia Munn since leaving Jen,\u201d speculating that the former co-stars were more than friends. Munn was quick to shoot down the rumors though, setting the record straight with an Instagram story. \u201cDear Tabloids, Please stop matching me with my friends\u2019 exes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo disrespect to people who date their friends\u2019 exes, that\u2019s just not my style.\u201d\n\n", "images":
