She told her she thought it was atrocious she and Harry were ruining Eugenie's wedding plans - that Harry should have known that Eugenie had always wanted to marry at St George's chapel,' says the insider.\n\nIt was confirmed last week that Eugenie has been forced to delay her wedding with the princess originally hoping to tie the knot in September, but settling for October.\n\nSt George's Chapel Getty\n\nCamilla - who is reported to be jealous of Kate and Meghan's rising popularity - has also been causing tension among the royals, with sources saying that one of the scheming duchess' more brazen plots involved trying to convince Kate that Meghan was trying to steal some of her staff.\n\nAccording to insiders, it was Camilla who was behind the reassignment of Amy Pickerill from Kate and Wills' communications officer to Meghan's first royal assistant.\n\nAn insider tells, 'It shows that Camilla will stop at nothing to cause trouble between Kate and Meghan.'\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/19664/ni-fan-28112017.jpg?height=220&format=png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-mobile-menu-colored.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/22543/ni0718-bws.png?format=png&height=158", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-nav.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/15186/17-07-08-prev-camilla.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/15186/17-07-08-prev-camilla.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714/https://www.newidea.com.au/camilla-royal-feud-meghan-markle", "title": "Camilla and Eugenie attack Kate and Meghan in shock public row", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "She may have been the picture of poise and elegance as she commenced her royal tour of Sweden and Norway alongside Prince William last week, but behind her smile, the Duchess of Cambridge had an altogether more worrying matter on her mind - her bitter rivalry with the Duchess of Cornwall.", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Camilla, Duchess Camilla, Meghan feud Camilla, royal feud, royal wedding, the royal wedding, royal wedding news, latest royal wedding news, the royal family, royal family news, latest royal family news", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea Magazine", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714/https://www.newidea.com.au/camilla-royal-feud-meghan-markle", "title": "Camilla and Eugenie attack Kate and Meghan in shock public row", "description": "She may have been the picture of poise and elegance as she commenced her royal tour of Sweden and Norway alongside Prince William last week, but behind her smile, the Duchess of Cambridge had an altogether more worrying matter on her mind - her bitter rivalry with the Duchess of Cornwall.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/15186/17-07-08-prev-camilla.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 799}}, "twitter": {"title": "Duchess of Cornwall and Princess Eugenie attack Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle", "description": "She may have been the picture of poise and elegance as she commenced her royal tour of Sweden and Norway alongside Prince William last week, but behind her smile, the Duchess of Cambridge had an altogether more worrying matter on her mind - her bitter rivalry with the Duchess of Cornwall.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/15186/17-07-08-prev-camilla.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205003714im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/camilla-royal-feud-meghan-markle"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517774810.525, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
