Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”

Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.

He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.","[""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20172%20172'%3E%3C/svg%3E"", 'https://staging.occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Occupy-Democrats-Logo.png', ""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"", 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/94cbb3560cca3d2e5338216af4b13172?s=172&d=mm&r=g', ""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"", ""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20156%20156'%3E%3C/svg%3E"", ""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3C/svg%3E"", 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/94cbb3560cca3d2e5338216af4b13172?s=80&d=mm&r=g', 'https://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/Occupy-Democrats-Logo-1.png', 'https://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupy-democrats.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/94cbb3560cca3d2e5338216af4b13172?s=156&d=mm&r=g']",https://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupy-democrats.jpg,[],['Colin Taylor'],https://occupydemocrats.com/2016/01/12/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/,Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom,[],1452632548.0,http://www.occupydemocrats.com,

“My pictures ask where does the truth end and the lies begin…where the subjective triumphs over the objective.”

Alison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’.

‘At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks’ says the artist ‘yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a ‘mental image’ rather than a direct record of reality’

Jackson’s staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jackson’s productions – where the likenesses are recognisable – use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation.",['https://web.archive.org/web/20160311224304im_/http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/favicon.ico'],https://web.archive.org/web/20160311224304im_/http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/favicon.ico,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20160311224304/http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/mental-images/,Mental Images,[],,https://web.archive.org,

Darrell Castle, the candidate for the Constitution Party, is on the ballot in more than two dozen states. Castle said his campaign has faced ballot access obstacles in California, Texas and Oklahoma. “Those states are virtually impossible for a party like mine because they cost so much money,” Castle said.

Castle isn’t on the ballot in Oklahoma. To be on the ballot there required signatures from at least 3 percent of all votes cast in the state in 2012, or about 40,000 signatures. Castle says this would likely require hiring professionals who often charge a few dollars for each signature.

As other non-major-party candidates have promised to do, De La Fuente has mounted several legal challenges for ballot access.","['https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/what-early-voters-missed/img/early-voting-promo.jpg', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/paths-to-victory/img/paths-to-victory-promo.jpg', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/2300-writein-promo.jpg', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-sampleballots-600.jpg?c=240', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-major-280.jpg?c=126', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_48h/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/30/Interactivity/Images/Campaign2016Star-24px-high.png', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-major-980.jpg?c=167', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/11/01/National-Politics/Graphics/new-promo.jpg', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatesperstate-280.jpg?c=211', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/10/27/National-Politics/Graphics/wikipedia-editing-graphic-promo-v2.jpg', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-sampleballots-280.jpg?c=334', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-policies-280.jpg?c=213', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-lesserknown-280.jpg?c=208', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatesperstate-600.jpg?c=436', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-notrunning-600.jpg?c=625', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-fec-280.jpg?c=362', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-notrunning-280.jpg?c=85', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-policies-980.jpg?c=49', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-sampleballots-980.jpg?c=195', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-major-600.jpg?c=328', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-policies-600.jpg?c=660', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-lesserknown-600.jpg?c=246', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png']",https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/2300-writein-promo.jpg,[],"['Denise Lu', 'Kevin Uhrmacher']",https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/,Thinking about writing in a candidate on Election Day?

6,http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston,"Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.

It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.

Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. ""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.

CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.

@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016

The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.

This is exactly how fake news spreads

But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.

The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.","['https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JWBU7azXgf9LLvV96N9-8sdRJA=/0x0:552x484/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:552x484):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7533929/Screen_Shot_2016_11_25_at_10.33.00_AM.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDjczkjZSskROKDL-J148Qrti2k=/0x0:1024x768/1200x800/filters:focal(431x303:593x465)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002053/drudgesiren.0.jpeg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JJ_FnfYh2eigozj1oaw-fFTEJTc=/0x0:600x358/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:600x358):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7533931/cnns_channel_accidentally_broadcast_hardcore_porn.jpg']",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg,[],"['Loren Grush', 'Nov']",https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston,The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads,[],1480003200.0,http://www.theverge.com,

In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.

“It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”

Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.

“So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”

“Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/23158392405_d3e3b60cb8_o-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lady-gaga-vilsbol-de-arce-mask-hat-150x150.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lady-gaga-vilsbol-de-arce-mask-hat-645x325.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-6G2CQMn_jcjgR.gif', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/egyptian-christian-beaten-by-Islamist1-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ted-And-Heidi-Cruz-1-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6021441883564&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gigi-hadid-150x150.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lady-gaga-vilsbol-de-arce-mask-hat-150x150.jpeg,[],['Eli The'],https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131832/http://therightists.com/lady-gaga-reveals-plan-to-cover-her-face-again-until-trump-gets-fired-from-office-and-i-feel-free-once-more/,Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again “Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More”,[],,https://web.archive.org,

11,straightstoned.com/pro-lifers-declare-ejaculation-murder-every-sperm-cell-life/,"The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.

“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”

Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.","['http://straightstoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/straightstoned.png', 'https://i2.wp.com/straightstoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PROLIFE.jpg?resize=550%2C296', 'http://straightstoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PROLIFE.jpg']",http://straightstoned.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PROLIFE.jpg,[],"[""Uaboo De'Call""]",http://straightstoned.com/pro-lifers-declare-ejaculation-murder-every-sperm-cell-life/,Pro-Lifers Declare “Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is A Life”,[],1462594693.0,http://straightstoned.com,

Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.

They’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!

Scary!

From HuffPo:

A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.

In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.

At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.

The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.

The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.

Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214im_/http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364-800x509.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214im_/http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214im_/http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214/http://usasnich.com/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president/,BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT,[],1481483004.0,https://web.archive.org,
15,www.haaretz.com/us-news/how-donald-trump-lost-the-war-on-christmas-1.5629520,"U.S. President Donald Trump has long positioned himself as a front-line soldier in the so-called War on Christmas, which made non-Christians justifiably nervous as they anticipated his administration’s first holiday season as a religiously charged, exclusionary and divisive affair.

Indeed, days before the holiday, a pro-Trump video featuring a little blonde girl lisping “Thank you, President Trump, for letting us say ‘Merry Christmas’ again,” as if the words had somehow been previously banned or outlawed.

>>Netanyahu enlists in Trump's army: ""Israel is a country that says 'Merry Christmas'""

And then on Christmas Eve, Trump tweeted that he was ""proud"" to have beaten back what he called an ""assault"" on the holiday.

The “War on Christmas” catchphrase was coined by former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, who claimed in 2004 that Christmas was “under siege” by “secular progressives.” It was triggered when the department store Macy’s decided not to greet customers with “Merry Christmas” but to wish them “Happy Holidays” instead.

O’Reilly seized on that as an example of an organized effort to eliminate Christian religious symbols in American public life. He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking “the Christ out of Christmas,” also blaming ""fantatics"" at the UN for trying to ""poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda.""

>>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'

Even before entering politics, Trump declared that so-called “political correctness” in the name of inclusivity and separation of church and state had gone too far. In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.

In part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would “bring back” the phrase “Merry Christmas.”

>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysis

In November 2015, Trump made headlines by proposing a boycott of Starbucks as punishment for manufacturing a red and white holiday cup that wasn’t explicitly Christmassy enough, promising a booing audience: “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again. That I can tell you.”

In his 2016 post-election victory lap around the country, his travels were officially dubbed the “Merry Christmas USA 2016 Victory Tour.” A year later, at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, “Merry Christmas” was front and center once again.

But despite all the hoopla, there has been little explicitly Christian content crossing the church-state line in the Trump era that could truly upset non-Christians.

There were a few warning signs earlier this month, though. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to “shine a spotlight” on seasonal “generosity.” She related the story of St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can’t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders’ story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such “stories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that’s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.”

Sanders’ message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.

Another small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, who pointed out that the proclamation declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital signed by Trump had been worded to state that the event was taking place on “this sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen.”

Shapiro noted on Twitter that during his years in the Obama White House, he had “worked hard (with mixed success) to get that standard formulation out of White House proclamations aimed at the Jewish community.” He was referring to the standard language for presidential proclamations, which explicitly state the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar.

But as the weeks passed and Christmas neared, there wasn’t much to justify concerns that the Trump White House would be transformed into an overtly Christian observance, excluding other religious traditions.

True, the Trump Hanukkah party was smaller, more low-key and more partisan than past celebrations in the Bush and Obama White Houses. But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it – though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Indeed, Ivanka Trump’s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the “return to Merry Christmas” message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.

She seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers “Happy Holidays!” with no mention of the “C-word,” in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father’s “War on Christmas” rhetoric.

For those who would chalk up Ivanka’s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.

Even Melania Trump’s much publicized – and much maligned – choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a crèche display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.

All of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump’s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-“Merry Christmas” and pro-“Happy Holidays” conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn’t at all reflective of mainstream America.

That feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a “Merry Christmas” than they had in the past.

The Pew poll reported: “A rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with ‘Merry Christmas.’”

According to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for “Merry Christmas” over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.

This year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business’ choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third – 32 percent – said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with “Merry Christmas” during the holidays.

Overall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump’s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly “declining.”

The number of Americans who believe that the “biblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events” is “shrinking,” it said, and “a declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.

It’s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his “War on Christmas” obsession shores up his status with evangelicals – even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don’t care much how it’s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.

In a blow to the “War on Christmas” theory from one of Trump’s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.

“Plenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a ‘Merry Christmas’ if the time is right,” Ozel said. “Just because some people say ‘Happy Holidays’ to people who don’t celebrate it doesn’t mean that we’re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.”","['https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.5671057/1018316866.jpg?precrop=2150,1244,x50,y71&height=698&width=1200', 'https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.5584582/1018316866.jpg?precrop=1304,1302,x135,y270&height=100&width=100', 'https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.5671057/1018316866.jpg?precrop=2150,1244,x50,y71&height=203&width=350']","https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.5671057/1018316866.jpg?precrop=2150,1244,x50,y71&height=698&width=1200",[],['Allison Kaplan Sommer'],https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/how-donald-trump-lost-the-war-on-christmas-1.5629520,How Donald Trump Lost the 'War on Christmas',[],,http://www.haaretz.com,
16,https://web.archive.org/web/20150214123436/http://newsexaminer.net:80/entertainment/secret-service-agent-says-obama-is-gay-muslim,"Washington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”





Berman: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

Berman: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”





Berman: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.”

Berman: What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking?

Horner: “Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama’s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed. We’re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.”

“We were just leaving the city limits of Rochester, New Hampshire when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, “Sure, what the hell.” So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester – some place called Wild Willy’s – and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire, ” Murray said with a laugh.

Murray added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Rochester. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

This amount of corruption is a next level thing that we haven’t seen portrayed this nonchalantly before. Namely, Michelle Obama’s mom failed to earn a pension that’s three times the amount of an average American family’s whole income!

It appears to be that just as Barack, the rest of the Obama’s never intended on getting jobs as us, the regular folks, because they got the chance to live on the backs of honest and hard working Americans that pay taxes.

Congress just announced the most stupid, unexplained and unethical waste of taxpayer money prepared by no other than Obama.

First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will get a big fat check for a lifetime worth 160K government pension when she takes off the White House next year, as concluded by congressional budget statements.

As concluded in documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson got to be eligible for the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s eight years in office.

Michelle Obama’s mom got to live better than a royalty in the White House, but they are still going to privilege her with $160,000 every year for the rest of her life just for being there her own granddaughters?

How pathetic excuse is that?

The President-elect of the United States, Donald Trump has on Wednesday issued a warning to the outgoing President of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama that he will make sure that the International Criminal Court (ICC) jails him for him mismanagement of State fund.



Talking to the NY Times, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa’s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country’s elections.

The praise was followed by a warning.

“As an outgoing President, you don’t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming President. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately. ” – Trump warned.

Trump went on further to describe the actions of the outgoing president as that of a ‘lizard’s shit’. “Don’t end your beautiful shit with a different color.” – he added.

Trump’s warning comes days after the outgoing president of Ghana increased allowances of its National Service Scheme personnel and also offered jobs to some people.

The incoming president and his team has condemned the act.

Trump also warned that if the Ghanaian President decides to lay in bed with the ‘recalcitrant’ Gambian President, who has sworn not to leave office, he will be dragged to ICC

” That asshole of a President better not help the Gambian polygamist to hold on to power. We will drag them to ICC”, Mr. Trump warned

She said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.

The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought.

“I DON’T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS,” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT’S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE.

“I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE’S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE,” SHE ADDED.

“DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS, I DON’T RECALL HIM EVER MAKING THE RIGHT ONE, AND THAT’S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THIS COUNTRY.”

AFTER OPENING FIRE AT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, GINSBERG TURNED TO HER OWNwi PLANS SHOULD DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY BECOME THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

“THERE’S NO NEED TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, SO I’M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT – I WILL RESIGN MY POSITION AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THAT HAPPENS. I CANNOT IMAGINE PERFORMING MY DUTIES UNDER THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT EVERY RULING WE AS AN INSTITUTION MAKE WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. I CAN TOLERATE THIS CHARADE OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT I COULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM AS PRESIDENT,” SHE SAID.

“I AM A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED LONG ENOUGH, AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I’VE HAD A PROSPEROUS AND FULFILLED LIFE,” JUSTICE GINSBERG ARGUED.

However, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when I’m aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170102225306im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/160712084406-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-exlarge-169.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170102225306im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170102225306im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/160712084406-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-exlarge-169.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170102225306/http://usanewstoday.org/index.php/2017/01/02/confirmed-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-resigning-post-associate-justice-supreme-court/,CONFIRMED !

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Obama has ordered a $200,000, life-sized, bronze statue of himself, with plans to install it in the entryway of the White House. The president says that his legacy “should not be diminished,” and that this is the only way he can “keep an eye” over Trump, as well as future presidents.

“I have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,” said Obama. “I have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.”

The statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.

“We thought about creating a new denomination for Obama, but George Washington has had plenty of time in the sun,” John Apple from the Federal Reserve said. “We’ve needed to change things up for a while now.”The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has released several comps but a design has not been finalized. The Bureau will release all compositions in early 2016 and poll the American public letting them help decide which design works best.

Many presidents were bandied about as the new face of the one-dollar bill including Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Reportedly, Reagan almost got the nod to replace Washington, but people within the Federal Reserve felt Obama brought a much needed multiracial mix to American currency.

“Obama being of mixed-race was probably what tipped things; however, we looked at overall accomplishments as well. Frankly, he [Obama] has done more for the betterment of this country than Reagan did, and he still has a year left. More importantly, the racial complexion of America has changed and putting Obama on the dollar bill really, really helps express that.”

An official republican response has not been issued, but Reserve leaders are confident that everyone will agree that this is a progressive step forward.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i0.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tump-exec_0.jpg?resize=310%2C165', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i1.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16443248_786683191479191_777616953_n.jpg?resize=310%2C165', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=640%2C274', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=478%2C204', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/04f7369b6a0345de4feea23dc6ef9952?s=90&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i1.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fff-640x444.png?resize=310%2C165', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i1.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hillarybreaking-696x378-678x378.jpg?resize=310%2C165']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=640%2C274,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728/http://trueamericans.me/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017,Barrack Obama Will Be On New $1 Dollar Bill 2017 – TRUEAMERICANS,[],,https://web.archive.org,

The actual leader of ISIS is known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

A fake news website is claiming Trump's recent executive order on immigration has lead to the capture of a terror suspect named Rasheed Muhammad.The article opens like this:Terror suspect, Rasheed Muhammad, was arrested on Tuesday, January 30, at approximately 1:32AM EST at John F. Kennedy International Airport. This marks the first successful story following President Trump's executive order to protect the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. Muhammad, 32, was questioned due to the heightened security measures that resulted from the presidential executive order. The suspect attempted to enter the country with a tourist visa and claimed to be visiting family in order to attend this year's Super Bowl LI.The story is definitely fake, even though fact checking websites like Snopes haven't debunked this hoax yet at the time of writing. There are several important clues that indicate the article is made up:","['https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/3/3369.jpg?1370302695', 'https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/flyfishingforum_com_profile.png', 'https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/masscops_com_profile.png', 'https://images.platforum.cloud/banners/masscops_com_banner_720w.jpg', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/25/25212.jpg?1379810617', 'https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/panamericaforums_com_profile.png', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/attachments/3/3803-f7515f3468437f1f33b8d7b15e9c9e7b.jpg', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/4/4753.jpg?1326071335', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/18/18443.jpg?1377270180', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/5/5826.jpg?1464622397', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/9/9508.jpg?1430780279', 'https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/skyscrapercity_com_profile.png', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/24/24786.jpg?1479908066', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/0/89.jpg?1381623768', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/masscops_com.svg', 'data:image/png;base64,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', 'https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/1/1361.jpg?1325869203']",https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/masscops_com_profile.png,[],[],https://www.masscops.com/threads/executive-order-leads-to-capture-of-isis-leader-rasheed-muhammad.185305/,"Executive Order Leads to Capture of ISIS Leader, Rasheed Muhammad",[],,https://www.masscops.com,

The United States President, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow all Ghana nationals travel to the United States without visas.

The new order, serving as a change in visa policy for Ghanaians traveling to the United States, would permit them stay in the U.S for a maximum period of 180 days for Tourism or Business purposes only. Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.

Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Ghana.

However, Ghanaians who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — the seven Muslim-majority countries “of concern”.

It has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Ghanaian Diplomats in the States.

A source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australia’s opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.

Allowing Ghanaians to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office. He has signed five new executive orders – including one to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects.

President Donald Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.

He also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal funds from organizations that promote abortion around the world, including the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in what activists say is the president’s first major pro-life action while in office.

The policy, known as the Mexico City Policy or the Global Gag Rule, was first ushered in under Ronald Reagan and bars federal funds from going to foreign organizations that perform abortions overseas or lobby for the practice’s legalization in other countries.

He has formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies as China’s influence in the region rises.

Fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office pulling the United States from the 12-nation TPP.

To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so important…if you haven’t read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!

And things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming “hoaxes.” He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing Ivanka’s merchandise (they were, that’s why they pulled the line).

The worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. That’s right, he tweeted “Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.”

Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.

This is terrifying, and there’s never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country.

Trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.

Donald Trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.

The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.

The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.

Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.

The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump’s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.

Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.

And now we learn that “President” Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.

This should come as no surprise since Trump ‘s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.

This involvement is another example of Trump’s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.

According to Ethics experts, Trump’s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.

The blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.

The Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump’s support of the cruel actions of the police.

We must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.

At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper.

Citing irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton.

Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillary’s signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process.

According to the filing obtained by CTN, the couple has a previously agreed-upon separation agreement or stipulation that will govern the manner in which the marital property is to be distributed in the event the divorce is finalized. It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers.

CTN has censored the couple’s address and the contact information for Hillary’s attorney in the respect of their privacy.

At this time, the Clinton’s are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clinton’s got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard.

The couple’s marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office.

It has been alleged in the past that the couple has a purely professional relationship and that they haven’t slept in the same bed for years

McCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.

The Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.

According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both.

McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.

Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his “unwavering support” to the foreign leader.

Former President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have denied any acrimony occurred during their phone call. Even if it had, that still does not mean that President Trump was not doing what he vowed to do, which is protecting America.

Perhaps then we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!

According to Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which is campaigning against Australia because they believe the country, is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs.

“Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”

Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesmen, Unthman Badar said; Well, if there’s one culture that knows a thing or two about “forced assimilation” it would be Islam.

He continued; “That this supposed oppression is due to an “exaggerated fear of a security threat”.

Obviously when “documented events” of world-wide terrorism inflicted within the last 2-decades has been overwhelming committed by Muslims in the name of Islam, the “exaggerated fear, becomes all too real.

Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that those seeking entrance do so with an understanding that they will adhere to the principles, and or laws of that host country.

If those seeking entrance can not abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.

Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their hows nation or be allowed to make demands that things are changed to suit them?

In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/

42,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead/,"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.

The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.

The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.

Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.

The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.

“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.

Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.","['https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/saudibacon-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psmmurders-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squirrelman3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flamegame-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/radiofun-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oldalienprobes-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afghansheep-120x67.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9f2243b88c0f9d7a4a1af198593781d1?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rushmorerescue-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mermaidrape3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com//worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/whale-greenpeace-300x208.png', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/giant-shark-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brosis-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eggfarmer-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voodoohairdresser-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pizzaman-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/manurevilla2-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TSAflashlight-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deadmother-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/themes/mh_newsdesk/images/factsdontmatter3.png', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/miamizoo2-180x101.jpg']",https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png,[],['Bob Flanagan'],https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead/,"Japanese Whaling Crew Eaten Alive By Killer Whales, 16 dead",[],1406528734.0,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com,

Target CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.

Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Cornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Cornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”

You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.

The program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:

While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus ion spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.

Democrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don’t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also don’t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:

“It’s not that much money in the grand scheme. We’ll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe we’ll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out. It’s be taxable income, so 28 percent of it will come back anyway. It’s not that big a deal. I’ve built things, great things, huge things worth far more.”

One thing is for sure. You can forget about all the stupidity the liberals are trying to sell you about lies and Russians and North Korea and all the rest of the humdrum day to day you shouldn’t concern yourself with anyway. What a waste of time. Grab some cash and have some fun on your leader, Donald Trump!

Checks will start arriving in the mail Friday.

UI Notice: The comments were found not to be true. PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.

Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

Cannasos reports:

By Jacqueline Austin

The Nobel winner thanked his doctors and family for their support through his brain cancerordeal. He also thanked Terrance ‘Scooby’ Williams of Dr. Green’s Greenery, a pot dispensary in Oakland, CA, for helping him find the right strain of cannabis.

Carter told his medicinal regiment to Sawyer“I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.

“Edibles are also good when traveling when smoking is not permitted.”

The future is bright for the 91-year-old humanitarian. Carter has resumed his house building for Habitat for Humanity and continues his weekly prayer service. “Marijuana is God’s medicine. I find indica is better than sativa, but there are plenty of good hybrids.“

Carter wasn’t endorsing pot smoking for everyone. “There is the right place and the right time to spark up a bowl. Don’t be a pothead but also be aware of the potential benefits of cannabis when used in moderation with the right music.

“I was never of big fan of alcohol but weed is the medicine I need. It also revived my love for peanuts. Have you ever eaten a peanut… on weed?”

With legal weed available in Colorado and Washington State and several states likely to pass the legalization next November during the Presidential elections, Carter will help support the cause in California, Oregon, and Massachusetts.

“Help build a house for those that need one and peace and sex above all else. I forget, what were we talking about?”

SAGINAW, Mich. — A man recently pardoned by former President Barack Obama was shot and killed by two men with assault-style rifles.

It happened at 9:40 p.m. on Jan. 23, at Bannum Place Federal Corrections Halfway House in Saginaw.

Michigan State Police spokesperson Lt. David Kaiser told WNEM the two masked men barged into the building and shot 31-year-old Demarlon Thomas of Saginaw.

He was shot multiple times by one of the gunmen, while the other held roughly two dozen others at the home at gunpoint. Thomas died at the scene.

“One person watched over a group of them while another subject located the victim and executed him,” Kaiser told MLive.com. “They were looking for this person.”

The two suspects then fled the area. No one else was injured.

It wasn’t immediately known how long Thomas had been out of prison and living in the halfway house.

Thomas was a former Sunny Side Gang member, according to Kaiser. He was busted in one of the biggest drug busts in Saginaw, known as “Operation Sunset.”

In 2008, he was sentenced to 19 years in prison for the distribution of five grams or more of cocaine. The operation effectively ended the Sunny Side Gang.

Thomas was among the 79 people pardoned on Nov. 22 by former President Obama.

“She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight”, Goldberg said.

“If it were me I wouldn’t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly greiving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn’t make sense to me”

After last night’s demonstration where several democrats in leadership roles refused to stand while the widow was being honored, Goldberg continues to make the point that liberals lack a significant amount of class.

After Trump made it clear that Obama had illegally tapped the phones at Trump Tower, the FBI issued a warrant for his arrest. Since then, little has been heard from the former president other than a denial.

This morning, Obama was stopped at a checkpoint at Toronto International Airport, where he was trying to fly to an unknown destination under the alias “Bruce Wilekenmeyer.” The CRMP officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the US Embassy.

After a short transport back to Washington, Obama was brought before a special session of US District Court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorney’s custody.

A court reporter who also moonlights for Breitbart took great personal risk to snap this photo since there are no photographs, video recording or any other recording devices allowed in federal courtrooms unless specifically ordered by a judge:

As you can see, he had also died the gray in his hair to help mask his appearance. It didn’t work. Share this and make sure everyone knows that the traitor was caught and will answer for his crimes!!!

De Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.

According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.

Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.

The 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.

“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.

The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.

“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.

The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","['https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resurect-350x199.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/logo-2.png', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/police-missouri.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sexdenmark-1-350x199.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/background-1.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ar15shortage-350x199.jpg']",https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png,[],[],https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/,Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby,[],1453391265.0,https://notallowedto.com,

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:

“The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.” “The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.”

The call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama’s phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will","['http://ads.vionservices.com/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=62&campaignid=14&zoneid=43&loc=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2Fbreaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap%2F&referer=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2F&cb=877be57af1', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bigstock-Confused-Black-Woman-12040076.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/High-Court-310x165.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Saviour-Kasukuwere-1-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Judith-Machiwenyika-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/High-Court-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wLophvWuocUH12mcjIvYJCr8.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/j38-110x75.jpg', 'http://ads.vionservices.com/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=61&campaignid=14&zoneid=42&loc=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2Fbreaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap%2F&referer=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2F&cb=5d35200dd8', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/donald-trump-hunting-africa.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ObamaCuffed-680x365-660x330.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pregnant-schoolgirl-450x300-1-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/donald-trump-zimbabwe.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/00540752_7e7d6865e38782aa6be0f9bd4d92ce73_arc614x376_w735_us1-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Judith-Machiwenyika-310x165.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8648.png', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_1-110x75.png', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/q71-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_2-110x75.png', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/my-passport-actually.jpeg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LAdy-Chevrons-110x75.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/31672_389326376405_524286405_445859.jpg', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_2-310x165.png', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico', 'https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_1-310x165.png']",https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico,[],[],https://zimbabwe-today.com/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-obamas-arrest-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/,BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap,[],,https://zimbabwe-today.com,
56,https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501/https://newslo.com/price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/,"Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November. He’s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he’s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. “My question is pretty straightforward,” Kline told Price. “Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?” Price’s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. “I took care of a lot of patients with cancer,” Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. “We don’t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.”

“But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you’re doing here, because you’re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?” Kline wouldn’t back down. “Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?” Price thought for a second, then replied: “Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone’s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me – I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.”

He continued, “I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who’ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he’s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I’m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we’re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.”

“Put simply, we have to plug some holes – of which, by the way, there are plenty – and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,” the orthopedic surgeon added. “Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it’s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer – I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Brian – they can’t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?”

“At the risk of sounding insensitive, we’ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it’s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it’s a lousy way to live anyway, and I’m sorry to say it out loud, but it’s the truth,” Price concluded.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501im_/https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewsLo-Logo-c.png', 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=120&d=https%3A%2F%2Fpoliticot.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fminify%2F_ui%2Fimages%2Fcommon%2Favatar.jpg&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501im_/https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewsLo-Logo-1.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501im_/https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tom_Price.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501im_/https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewsLo-Logo-w.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501im_/https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tom_Price.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20200810061501/https://newslo.com/price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/,Tom Price: “It’s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly”,[],,https://web.archive.org,

58,https://www.huzlers.com/snoop-dogg-arrested-conspiracy-talking-murder-trump-video/,"Snoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video “Lavender,” in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:

“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”

The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.

According to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he’s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump’s America if you say and do stupid crap.

According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:

President Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.

Ryan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:

Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.

Relate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.

This isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:

“Mr. Speaker…You’re fired.”

And that, as they say, is that.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/palin-obama-stupid-1.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13016872_10209797995848921_644118154_o.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=48&d=wavatar&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/patriotic-pets1.jpg?resize=669%2C405', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Patriot_avatar_1480661748-48x48.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/trump-ryan.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/women-in-military.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?resize=678%2C381', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/59fffcd52a755b033fae93e2fce8eb69?s=48&d=wavatar&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0c76ee573d0057032a25d6bbe2afa632?s=48&d=wavatar&r=g']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170315011720im_/https://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630,[],"['About Stryker', ""Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can'T Stand The Lazy"", 'Cryba', 'Fantasy World Liberals Live In.

This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

South Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it’s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.

DENVER, COLORADO –

With the new laws in effect in Colorado, major sports organizations are looking for ways to cash in on the newest legal cash crop in the state.

Sources are reporting that Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies plan to sell food items which contain marijuana at concession stands during games next season.

The first item on the list? Pot Brownies.

An official within the Rockies organization stated that the Rockies organization has given the green light to concession stands selling marijuana brownies.

High ranking officials in the Rockies organization say they are thrilled at the new menu item since they note that it will bring in tens of thousands of dollars per month.

The Rockies head office is hoping that the sale of marijuana brownies will also boost sales of other concession items. What better way to sell concessions that to give everyone in the stadium the munchies?

SIDENOTE: An inside source with the organization said that it appears that the strain of marijuana that will be used in the making of the marijuana brownies will be Durango Bango which is considered to be the very best weed in the Rocky Mountain State.","['https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/2809-featured-75x75.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/2300-featured-75x75.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PEBanner1.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baby-mermaid-220x180.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/themes/bresponzive_pro/images/default-image.png', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/2451-featured-75x75.jpg', 'http://assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pin_it_button.png', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/es-logo-white-300x83.png', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/HomeDepot-220x180.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana-300x181.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AD-Square-01.jpg', 'https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/2410-featured-75x75.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8eee9fa07431846d350323bf3532ef34?s=60&d=mm&r=g']",https://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana.jpg,[],[],https://empiresports.co/colorado-rockies-baseball-team-to-sell-marijuana-brownies-at-their-concession-stands/,Colorado Rockies Baseball Team To Sell Marijuana Brownies At Their Concession Stands,[],1393566555.0,http://www.empiresports.co,

While little information is available as of yet, one agent did tell a reporter for the Washington Examiner that the arrest came at the direct order of the president:

“Mrs. Pelosi’s arrest order comes directly from the Oval Office,” said Special Agent Matthew Derpmore, “She’s wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president. That’s all we’re authorized to say at this time.”

The White House OIP has confirmed that report, calling Pelosi a usurper and a threat to the office of President Trump:

Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi’s arrest for conspiacy to overthrow the office of the President is being taken very seriously. She is said to be at the head of a select group of congressmen who have set in motion plans to use the president’s allegedly unlawful actions to begin imeachment hearings. Without evidence and with a clear denial from the president of these allegations such actions warrant charges of conspiracy and possibly even treason.

Pelosi’s office hasn’t issued a statement yet. According to records obtained by Breitbart, three other congressmen are also wanted and are currently having warrants against them served.

The undisclosed location near Rosenberg will represent a previously unknown planet in the Star Wars universe.

No details were released as to exactly when production would take place in the Rosenberg area but they stated that it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before that time period, however. Local fans of the film series were understandably excited about the news and especially excited about the prospect of becoming an extra in the film after producers made this short statement released to the press earlier today:

“We think that Rosenberg is a great place to find the hundreds of extras for our alien population and we’re very excited about filming here.”

The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.

Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.

Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.

When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”

According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.

Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.

According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.

Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.

Claims 'fact-checkers' are paid to 'appear to prevent damage' while pushing an agenda

© press Former managing editor at Snopes Brooke Binkowski says the 'fact-checker' is pushing 'propaganda'

Snopes is paid by Facebook to push ""propaganda,"" according to the former managing editor of the ""fact-checker,"" who claims the social media giant ""doesn't care"" about facts and is using journalists to promote an agenda so it can ""pass the buck.""

According to a bombshell report by the Guardian, several current and former Facebook fact-checkers have stepped forward and spoken out to reveal their distrust in the social network and their fact-checking employers.

Facebook has fact-checking partnerships with Snopes, PolitiFact, Factcheck.org, the Weekly Standard, and Associated Press, and uses the information provided by these organizations to reduce the reach of posts that are ""debunked"" in their News Feed.

The partnering with these fact-checkers has come under heavy criticism, mainly due to the almost-monopolized influence news on Facebook has, which is then being filtered out by unregulated individuals who are often financially motivated and express political bias.

“They’ve essentially used us for crisis PR,” declared former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski during an interview with the Guardian.

“They’re not taking anything seriously.

""They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buck…

""They clearly don’t care.”

“You’re not doing journalism anymore. You’re doing propaganda,” she continued, adding, “They threw us under the bus at every opportunity.”

Another former Snopes employee, Kim LaCapria, recently left the company over its partnership with Facebook, accusing it of focusing only on the “appearance of trying to prevent damage without actually doing anything,” and expressing distaste with the fact that Snopes was being paid by Facebook.

LaCapria said she was particularly upset to learn that Facebook was paying Snopes: “That felt really gross … Facebook has one mission and fact-checking websites should have a completely different mission.”

Aside from allegedly being paid by Facebook, Snopes also generates revenue by filling its website with advertisements from Google Adsense, asking for donations from readers via PayPal, and has an active GoFundMe campaign to ""Save Snopes"" which has so far generated over $850,000 of its $2 million goal.

Of course, it's understandable that a website has overheads that need to be covered, but when a company is primarily driven by profit, how can they be trusted to remain non-partisan?

According to a report by the Daily Mail, Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused of embezzling thousands from the company.

Mikkelson's ex-wife Barbara, claimed in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on ""himself and prostitutes.""

During the lengthy and bitter legal dispute, CEO David Mikkelson also claimed to be underpaid and was demanding the ""industry standard"" or at least $360,000 a year.

Being motivated by ""facts"" is apparently very lucrative.

And in the case of Snopes, their business model is a simple, yet devastatingly effective one since they partnered with Facebook and Google: They debunk viral news, and posts.

Therefore, if a post goes viral on social media, and Snopes says that it's ""false,"" then it will be flagged as so and Facebook will place a link to the ""fact-check,"" thus driving more traffic and revenue to Snopes.

Due to this arrangement, it adds a clear incentive to mark a viral news story as false rather than confirming lesser-known facts as true.

© press Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused on embezzling company money

Over recent months this push to flag big news stories as ""false,"" mainly from conservative websites, has become more apparent.

In November, Breitbart accused Snopes of attempting to ""wash away"" the story of armed members of the New Black Panther Party campaigning for the Democrat gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, Stacey Abrams.

According to Breitbart, the move was an ""openly partisan"" attempt to protect Abrams after the damaging story went viral.

Earlier this month, The Daily Caller also accused Snopes of left-bias after it ""botched"" its fact-check of a viral meme that was mocked within political circles for spreading false information.

Snopes said that the “general idea” of the meme was “correct,” yet, according to the TheDCNF, the fact-checker intentionally framed it that way as it portrayed President Trump in a negative light if the ""wildly misleading"" meme was true.

In Snopes ""transparency"" disclaimer, it states that it operates ""without any partisan considerations,"" saying:

""We don’t choose or exclude items for coverage based on whether they deal with Republican/Democratic, conservative/liberal, or religious/secular issues.""

Despite this statement, the left-leaning bias of their fact-checkers is clear.

Snopes' ""science dude"" Alex Kasprak makes no secret of his political bias, and one look at his Twitter account shows it is filled with anti-Trump rhetoric and retweets of Trump-bashing posts.

The only way to report on that ""totally clears the president"" tweet is to highlight it as an example of our president's abject delusion, not as a valid legal opinion or as ""breaking news"" — Alex H. Kasprak (@alexkasprak) December 8, 2018





Prior to joining Snopes, Kasprak wrote for left-wing news outlets Motherboard and BuzzFeed and is pegged as a ""science writer"" who mainly ""debunks"" science-related articles.

It comes as no surprise then that Kasprak mainly fact-checks conservative news sites, often using derogatory language when describing the outlets and their writers, using terms such as ""right-wing blog"" and ""junk news.""

Biting the hand that feeds

Snopes apparent bias has seen the company suffer considerably over recent months as it continues to abuse its influence over Facebook's News Feed to promote a political agenda.

Visits to snopes.com have plummeted by almost half over recent months as users are seemingly losing trust in the organization.

According to website data tool SimilarWeb, visits to Snopes dropped another 20 percent in November to 19.59 million for the month.

This number is a considerable drop from their July figure of 37.79 million, representing a staggering 48.16 percent drop in website traffic in just four months.

While it's unclear what has caused this drop, when you consider that being flagged as ""fake news"" on Facebook cuts reach to the websites being debunked, it's clear to see that attacking the sources of their viral ""fact-checks,"" is hardly sustainable if it destroys the sites that it continually attacks.

The appearance of trying to prevent damage

“Why should we trust Facebook when it’s pushing the same rumors that its own fact checkers are calling fake news?” an unnamed Facebook fact-checker told the Guardian.

“It’s worth asking how do they treat stories about George Soros on the platform knowing they specifically pay people to try to link political enemies to him?[…] Working with Facebook makes us look bad.”

According to Breitbart, one fact-checker who has reportedly “long worked” with Facebook even referred to the social network as a “terrible company,” declaring, “and, on a personal level, I don’t want to have anything to do with them,” while another fact-checker proclaimed, “Most of us feel it’s more trouble than it’s worth.”

Facebook started its fact-checking efforts following President Trump’s 2016 presidential election victory and is even expanding into fact-checking images and videos.

Left-wing biases have been found at nearly all Facebook fact-check partners in the United States, including Snopes, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard.

An investigation revealed that Snopes employs left-wing people almost exclusively, with some of its most prominent fact-checkers openly describing themselves as “progressive” and expressing anti-Trump sentiment.

A satirical article from popular satire website Babylon Bee about CNN using a washing machine to “spin the news,” was also nearly removed by Facebook after Snopes fact-checked it as false.

One of Facebook’s other top fact-checking partners, Politifact, is funded by a frequent Clinton Foundation donor, and gave preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election — rating 51 percent of Clinton’s claims as true versus just over 15 percent for Trump.

Even a 2013 article from one of Facebook’s other fact-checking partners, the Weekly Standard, claimed Politifact “has it out for Republicans,” and the Weekly Standard itself has also pushed out misleading information during its partnership with Facebook.

UPDATE: Since this article was published, and subsequently went viral on social media, Snopes CEO David Mikkelson denied the information we presented in this article. Snopes didn't ""fact-check"" or ""debunk"" any of the information, nor did they present any evidence to refute the claims. Mikkelson, however, saw fit to abuse his position as Facebook approved ""fact-checker"" and flagged our story as a ""hoax"" with Facebook, pulling it from users' News Feed, immediately squashing the story as a result. Make of that what you will.","['http://www.neonnettle.com/videos/images/snopes-paid-facebook-propaganda-editor-2141218.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/Candace-Owens-Facebook-is-Paying.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/trump-ap-300.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/consevartives-do-not-trust-facebook-t10719.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/videos/images/biden-188.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/democrats-hillary-clinton-best-option-2024-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/driver-smashed-car-home-homeowner-shoot-dead-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/feed/images/democrats-rebuttal-nunes-memo-t.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/ted-cruz-jan-6-3.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/assets/ads/steve-quayle-ad.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/steve-harvey-woke-killed-comedy-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/man-who-threatened-to-kil-.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/videos/images/snopes-paid-facebook-propaganda-editor-1141218.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/california-tax-39s.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/bab-d-38821.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/Biden-america-soviet.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/23m-afghans-39.jpg', 'https://neonnettle.com/news/images/snopes-paid-facebook-propaganda-editor-1141218.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/sphere/images/florida-school-girls-plot-kill-15-drink-blood-t251018.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/usa-today-destigmatizing-pedophilia-misunderstood-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/mccarthy-democrats-trying-frame-trump-afraid-2020-t131119.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/videos/images/snopes-paid-facebook-propaganda-editor-3141218.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/scientist-selling-research-chinese-communist-party-t6122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/assets/img/telegram-tap.png', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/Over-Half-of-Sex-Trafficking.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/features/images/epstein-nbc.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/bide-doj-domestic-terrorism-unit-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-dangerous-un-american-t10519.jpg']",https://neonnettle.com/news/images/snopes-paid-facebook-propaganda-editor-1141218.jpg,[],['Jay Greenberg'],https://neonnettle.com/news/5930-snopes-paid-to-push-propaganda-by-facebook-former-editor-reveals-,"Snopes Paid to Push ‘Propaganda’ by Facebook, Former Editor Reveals",[],,http://www.neonnettle.com,

Two United States Representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of President Trump. These aren’t some off-the-hook left wing extremists, they’re typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.

Rep. Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.

According to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men’s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. It’s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:

“Their plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a ‘design for a new video game,’” said Special Agent George Ketterman, “While they never actually used the president’s name or purchased any of the items listed in the ‘game,’ like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.”

In unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trump’s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.

NBC News tried to reach out to the men’s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn’t find one. It would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the Patriot Act.

Welcome to Trump’s America, liberals. If you step out of line you’ll be removed altogether.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000im_/http://proudleader.com/wp-content/themes/viral/images/shadow.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3512574e2aed68d91fa331534eca358a?s=32&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22cee9c018d6b9552c0d69681b973d3d?s=32&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000im_/http://proudleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/25602642832_4ae1e69452_b.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b186f7fe976e26d9695fedabb8639c4c?s=32&d=mm&r=g']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000im_/http://proudleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/25602642832_4ae1e69452_b.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170329080000/http://proudleader.com/2-liberal-democrat-congressmen-arrested-planning-trumps-assassination/,2 Liberal Democrat Congressmen Arrested For Planning Trump’s Assassination,[],1490115822.0,https://web.archive.org,
73,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/europe/fake-news-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-georgia.html?_r=0,"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America’s fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.

They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.

But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)

“My audience likes Trump,” he said. “I don’t want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.”

Some of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that “the Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.” Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.

So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze’s who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: “Stop it Liberals…Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here’s Why.” That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze’s work, was pilfered from the web.

Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people’s stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)","['https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9660de641d2d62a26a688f50f4fbcc05c5cfc027a31af0249b35ff77fd4f203c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/26/world/26FAKE2/26FAKE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9660de641d2d62a26a688f50f4fbcc05c5cfc027a31af0249b35ff77fd4f203c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,[],"['Andrew Higgins', 'Mike Mcintire', 'Gabriel J.X.

John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”

“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”

He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”

“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”

“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sean-Spicer.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20177638393_fdae28e39d_b-645x325.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/96a8b6eb-b644-4e69-814a-96cf5ac2ce01-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20177638393_fdae28e39d_b.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lindsey-graham-150x150.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718im_/http://www.newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20177638393_fdae28e39d_b.jpg,[],['Alex Stevan'],https://web.archive.org/web/20170408064718/http://www.newslo.com/kasich-woman-not-intelligent-enough-keep-legs-closed-can-entrust-abortion-decision/,"Kasich: “If A Woman Is Not Intelligent Enough To Keep Her Legs Closed, How Can We Entrust The Abortion Decision To Her?”",[],1481839090.0,https://web.archive.org,

The shooting of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood did not appear to be random, according to Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris, but a motive was not immediately clear.

“Whether or not he was specifically targeted, or whether this was because of the uniform he was wearing or the place he pulled up to in the morning, we just don’t know that right now,” Dorris said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Dorris said authorities were still “actively investigating” the shooting.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rebpun1_cczad.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GetFile.aspxguidc8fa67a6-bde6-4fa6-a68f-ec3c64fad46eampSiteNameNewsmaxampmaxsidesize600-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GetFile.aspxguid79db61d1-995c-4907-882c-3191196b86fbampSiteNameNewsmaxampmaxsidesize600-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/209e0bf4ff58960a84742cb45c7d2900?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Xico-2.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leave-no-trace-h-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GetFile.aspxguiddb0b5e6a-5df1-4f17-a15c-134390872db2ampSiteNameNewsmaxampmaxsidesize600-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1489359024132-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/themes/Newspaper/images/no-thumb/td_100x70.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nike-640x480-1-218x150.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triplethreat_inlinead.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thing_sidebar.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/soucon.fw_-1-300x74.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1489497427404-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GetFile.aspxguid0aee2e75-c740-4874-85b4-f6863429b0cdampSiteNameNewsmaxampmaxsidesize600-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/confed_ss_xtra.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/themes/Newspaper/images/no-thumb/td_218x150.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1489422527705-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GetFile.aspxguidb3f61f0e-0e63-428a-bd09-86ff6db8a51bampSiteNameNewsmaxampmaxsidesize600-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/green-juice-tying-running-shoes_h-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/001-100x70.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/themes/Newspaper/images/no-thumb/thumbnail.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gadsden_news_ad.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326im_/http://southernconservativextra.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Xico-2.png,[],['Please Enter Your Name Here'],https://web.archive.org/web/20170412155326/http://southernconservativextra.com/thall/texas-law-enforcement-officer-fatally-shot-upon-arriving-for-work-by-3-muslim-refugee-do-you-support-to-deport-them/,Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee.

In a recent report by the Boston Leader, 27 year-old Michael Fitzpatrick lost his testicles after trying to create a home-made smoking device out of an old scuba tank. The process included using an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank before using a regulator to inhale.

According to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick invited his buddies over to check out the ‘Scuba Bong,’ a name that is both inaccurate and sounds much too much like ‘Scuba Bomb,’ when the accident occurred. While attempting to attach the air compressor to the tank, the victim knocked over the tank causing an explosion that would send shrapnel into his groin, severing his balls clean off.

None of his friends were injured in the accident.

The tank in question was fashioned in the early 90’s with a type of aluminum that is known for its capacity to rupture. However, the company that built the tank is unlikely to cover an insurance claim due to the victim’s use of the tank as a smoking device. Fitzgerald is still in the hospital and his condition has been downgraded from ‘critical’ to ‘serious.’

78,http://now8news.com/united-airlines-flight-attendant-slaps-crying-baby/,"During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.

The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”

After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.

The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.

The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries. The parents say they are reaching out to an attorney, refusing to give any further statements.","['http://now8news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/united-airlines-bad-pr-777x437.jpg', 'http://now8news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/united-airlines-bad-pr.jpg', 'http://now8news.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cropped-cropped-unnamed.png']",http://now8news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/united-airlines-bad-pr.jpg,[],[],http://now8news.com/united-airlines-flight-attendant-slaps-crying-baby/,United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight,[],1491867217.0,http://now8news.com,

Malia Obama, who has decided that as an adult she wants to be a pot smoking, rap listening, twerking party girl, has been ousted from the student roster at Harvard University. The school’s chancellor, Malcolm Little, said that regardless of her status as a former first daughter, the rules are the rules and she won’t be welcome there this fall.

The stunning announcement came after Malia was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends. Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is “weed friendly,” but that doesn’t change the fact that she broke the rules.

Malia’s lawyer has pointed out that the school has turned the other way on the marijuana issue when their entire rowing team, made up of 14 white males, was caught selling and smoking marijuana cigarettes during the offseason. Chancellor Little remarked that the difference was that the members of the rowing team are hard-working, established students whose parents are paying cash for their education while Malia hasn’t attended yet, isn’t planning on playing a sport and is going to the school on a combination of a scholarship from the Clinton Foundation and taxpayer-funded grants.

80,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/04/trump-on-revamping-the-military-were-bringing-back-the-draft/,"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.

“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”

Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”

Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”

The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”

Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.","['https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/54f33cfe084bfcdaa0abc1da00e9eadf?s=56&d=mm&r=g',

During a Fox News discussion about the recent United Airlines public relations debacle, Smith noted that lawmakers were calling for an investigation and that the airline lost millions in stock value. “Airlines disgust me,” Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera told Smith. “They do everything to maximize profit.” “There’s nothing wrong with maximizing profit,” Smith insisted. “That’s what they’re supposed to do as a publicly traded airline.” “But when you book and overbook,” Rivera replied, “paid passengers have to give up their seats. This is not business. This is reckless, foolhardy imposition of your own personal convenience – what happened to ‘the customer is always right’?”

Smith continued, “But look, I get where you’re coming from with this, but at the end of the day, we’re talking here about an airline, a company that exists solely for the purpose of transporting passengers from one place in the country to another. If you just consider the fact that 15 or so years ago we had two airplanes crash into the World Trade Center in New York City, I think you’ll understand that they were right to be edgy. And that goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American. As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, it’s obvious that his behavior suggests that he’s from another part of the world, and that’s that.”

Rivera asked, “You can’t possibly be serious, Sandra? Are you actually saying that the company was right to, first, overbook the flight, and then secondly, call security to beat up the man simple because his behavior suggested he wasn’t a true American? And what does that even mean?” Again, Smith wouldn’t be confused. “Look Geraldo, at the end of the day, you have to understand the fact that the moment Americans see a non-white person sitting next to them on a plane, they get chills. Some of them get outright angry as well, and while that’s not ideal, it’s certainly understandable. We can’t blame people for fearing for their lives because of the terrible tragedy this country endured during 9/11.”

“What’s more, I would even go so far as to say that the man had it coming for one simple reason. If that had been a white person, they would have likely stepped out of the plane and waited for the next flight, not to mention that they would probably also have been compensated for the inconvenience in some way or another. Instead, since this guy wasn’t white, his reaction was also different from that of a white person, which is why he refused to give up his seat. If he’d done that, everything would have gone more smoothly and without incident. This way, because he was stubborn, he ended up getting the short end of the stick. That’s just not how white people behave, and non-whites in this country need to learn that. We’re more civilized than the rest, which is why we’re at the top of the food chain. The guy had it coming, end of story,” she concluded.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith-640x325.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sean-Spicer-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sean-Spicer.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith.jpg,[],['Alex Stevan'],https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744/http://politicass.com/fox-news-sandra-smith-everybody-see-united-airlines-passengers-behavior-not-genuine-american/,Fox News Sandra Smith: “Everybody Could See From The United Airlines Passenger’s Behavior That He Was Not A Genuine American”,[],1492039622.0,https://web.archive.org,

“You would have a bunch of people who know nothing about taxes trying to look through and trying to come up with assumptions on things they know nothing about,” Eric Trump said Wednesday on CNBC.

“It would be foolish to do. I’m actually the biggest proponent of not doing it.”

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has faced criticism for refusing to release his tax returns.

He has repeatedly pushed back against calls to release the documents, saying he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The IRS has said nothing prevents Trump from releasing his tax returns.

Eric Trump said on Wednesday that there is ""no tax attorney in the world who will tell you to release your tax returns while you're under a standard routine audit.""

He added, ""You don't learn that much from a tax return.

""You learn a lot more when you look at somebody's assets. You know how many hotels we have around the world. You know how many golf courses we have around the world. You know every single building we have.""

He is to sign an executive order to this effect this week.

In an interview with Fox News, President Trump described Indians living in the USA as lawless warriors with a history of attacking and killing US citizens. He claimed, “I’ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can’t trust these Indians.”

President Trump consulted with the appropriate members of the government and found that most Indians do not possess the relevant immigration documents. “That means they are here illegally. I had to act.”

Further criticism is to be found on the President’s Twitter account:

He also tweeted:

The White House has announced that Indians will be given a three month period in which to leave the country. India is to pay for their flights.

Trump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the country’s own constitution against them.

“You know right that this is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russia Federation. I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you” – Trump warned.

Trump went on to invite all Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.

“As this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.” – Trump urged.

Russia’s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.

The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.

The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the group’s administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.

“The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russia’s ministry of justice and deem the ‘Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia’ organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,” said judge Yuri Ivanenko. “The property of the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization is to be confiscated to the state revenue.”

A lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents “pose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public security”.

85,www.firstpost.com/world/donald-trump-to-issue-an-executive-order-to-ban-facebook-across-us-3363348.html,"Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.

Year 2017 does not seem to be going well for the United States of America. Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.

On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.

Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. ""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.

Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.

Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.

The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.

Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.

In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.

Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.

Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.

Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.

On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.

Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.

Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.

Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.

Former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin was the victim of a horrendous crime this morning while driving to meet a friend on the Pacific Coast Highway. She was run off the road in what authorities are calling a hit and run and nearly killed. The SUV she was driving rolled over several times and ended up in a drainage ditch.

Governor Palin was taken to a local hospital under an alias in case the hit and run were on purpose and not a random act of reckless driving. According to her spokesman, she is currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh.

The Palin family has been notified and are currently making their way to her bedside. The FBI has been dispatched to the scene to collect evidence. The vehicle that ran her off the road was caught on a traffic camera and is being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the northwest.

Trump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.

Graham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.”

“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.”

Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson.

“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.”

Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.

“I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.

“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. “They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.”

Although many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned Trump’s accusations, they continue to support him.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001im_/https://i0.wp.com/truetrumpers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lindsey-graham.jpg?resize=605%2C328', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001im_/https://i2.wp.com/truetrumpers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/michelle-obama.jpg?resize=310%2C165', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001im_/https://i0.wp.com/16004-presscdn-0-50.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/beck-cheetos-575x431.jpg?resize=575%2C431', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001im_/http://images.politico.com/global/2013/11/10/131112_iraq_veteran_ap_605.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001im_/http://i2.wp.com/conservativefighters.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trump_un_0320.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001im_/https://i0.wp.com/truetrumpers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lindsey-graham.jpg?resize=605%2C328,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170322070001/http://truetrumpers.com/lindsey-graham-threatens-to-convert-to-democrat-if-republicans-dont-dump-trump,Lindsey Graham Threatens To Convert To Democrat If Republicans Don’t Dump Trump – True Trumpers,[],,https://web.archive.org,

Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance.

She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:

“They was all just right out there in the open drinkin’ and lettin’ their dogs go at it. I saw some smoking weed. Some were doing other things I don’t know. All those dudes had that baggy pants thing. They weren’t the types of people you’d expect that girl to be with.”

According to the Secret Service, Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasn’t seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. Her parents have not been available for comment.

Public records show she was released on her own recognizance and given a court date of later this month for arraignment.","['http://breaking13news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ec1d0affbd4b8a6f7518e9783398bbb3fc865d64.jpeg', 'http://breaking13news.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cropped-breaking13-small.png']",http://breaking13news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ec1d0affbd4b8a6f7518e9783398bbb3fc865d64.jpeg,[],[],http://breaking13news.com/malia-obama-arrested-gang-thugs-chicago/,Malia Obama Arrested With A Gang Of Thugs In Chicago,[],1502401634.0,http://breaking13news.com,

The ship, which was supposed to be carrying “emergency supplies,” was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN:

“We received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship, The Chelsea, was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didn’t know what to expect, but what we found was simply…surreal. In the middle of the ship’s large manifest of containers, most of which were empty, we found 14 containing…people. Yes, people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K, anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect.”

Immigration was immediately called and found that of the 460 people on board illegally, not one had been through any kind of vetting process. After running the men through facial recognition, they found more than a dozen suspected terrorists who are on the US no-fly list. Those men were about to be unleashed on the public for $40K each.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mmm-191x120.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trump-National-Debt.001-1-191x120.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OBAMA_0984-696x392-678x381-191x120.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BALTIMORE.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BALTIMORE.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952/http://dailyusaupdate.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-cargo-ship-raided-port-baltimore-reveals-sick-secret/,BREAKING: Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship Raided At Port Of Baltimore Reveals Sick Secret,[],1494508853.0,https://web.archive.org,
93,www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/11/12/lance-armstrong-yellow-jerseys-picture/1699693/,"Chris Chase, USA TODAY Sports

Lance Armstrong let his Twitter followers -- still 3.8 million strong -- know he was back in Austin this weekend and had someone take a picture to show how he was spending a lazy Saturday afternoon.

""Back in Austin and just layin' around,"" he wrote in the tweet. He attached a picture of himself laying on a couch in a room that just happened to have seven yellow Tour de France jerseys on the wall. Purely random, I'm sure.

It's not a #humblebrag as much as it's a #shoveitinyourfacebrag. It's cocky, it's condescending and it's not going to help Armstrong's battered public image. Contrition, not defiance, is the way to go.

Armstrong was banned for life last month by the International Cycling Union and stripped of those seven Tour wins. (The jerseys, apparently, can stay.)

Look, I'm on Lance Armstrong's side, as much as one can be on the side of a suspected/known cheater. His cycling wins may have been a sham (just like victories by most athletes in the sport) but his work for cancer research, awareness and patients has been inspirational. Would it have been better if Armstrong stayed clean, became a middling cyclist and Livestrong never existed? I don't see how any logical person could make that argument. Shades of gray cloud the picture, of course, but I still think his net contribution to our world is greater than his flaws.

Regardless, Armstrong stepped down Monday from the Livestrong board. He founded the charity in 1997.

If pictures like this are any indication, Armstrong has moved past denial into the anger phase of his coping. Next he'll be trying to buy Tour titles off Miguel Indurain, followed by his growing a beard phase and then he'll accept his actions, sit down for an interview with Oprah and get back into the good graces of the American public. It doesn't feel like it now, but it'll happen one day.","['https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/gameon/2012/11/12/media_22700756-1-16_9.jpg?width=591&height=334&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp', 'https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/gameon/2012/11/12/afaf22-16_9.jpg?width=179&height=101&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp']",https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/gameon/2012/11/12/media_22700756-1-16_9.jpg?width=591&height=334&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,[],[],https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/11/12/lance-armstrong-yellow-jerseys-picture/1699693/,Lance Armstrong's defiant Twitter photo shows him relaxing with seven yellow jerseys,[],1352649600.0,http://www.usatoday.com,

NYC Police Sargeant Michael O’Leary told reporters that while he couldn’t confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.

EMT’s on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Mary’s where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.

The car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. It’s obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown. The perpetrator fled the scene. The Ford Explorer he was driving had no plates or VIN numbers. Police have impounded it as evidence.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Tucker’s family tonight. This is a developing story that will be updated.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002626im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/f-11-640x445-640x381-191x120.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002626im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breaking-2-191x120.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002626im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/carlson.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002626im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/3CE326C400000578-4195176-image-a-4_1486371087805-1-191x120.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002626im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/carlson.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170521002626/http://dailyusaupdate.com/breaking-fox-star-tucker-carlson-critical-condition-head-collision-driving-home/,BREAKING: Fox Star Tucker Carlson In Critical Condition After Head On Collision Driving Home,[],1494677767.0,https://web.archive.org,

As a result of this, an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean, the sources say. The money raised from this drug flight was intended to be used to finance the operations of Daesh (formerly known as ISIS), the sources say. This impoundment follows the capture of an Obama linked ship containing 4.2 tons of cocaine, the sources note.

Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.

The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.

This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.

However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.

It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.

It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.

“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”

When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?”

NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.”

The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.

You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns.","['https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Q5zqCpCi5knwLR21mSxYYA.jpeg?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ppUOUkZnrDj_XXffHq0qzw.jpeg?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/140/140/1*Rmk-w3UdLDkVHB5abXZnCg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/140/140/1*ppUOUkZnrDj_XXffHq0qzw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/focal/140/140/50/39/1*u7qc2k19s6UQ3vHbvYSgcA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hn4v1tCaJy7cWMyb0bpNpQ.png?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/140/140/1*Q5zqCpCi5knwLR21mSxYYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/140/140/1*msyRC-dOz9TXyW9HPlCK6A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/140/140/1*hn4v1tCaJy7cWMyb0bpNpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/56/56/0*z2fZ_AZMwya0CYRu.', 'https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TulxsnMl7VJuGMwVeVeeDQ.jpeg?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*u7qc2k19s6UQ3vHbvYSgcA.jpeg?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/152/152/1*sHhtYhaCe2Uc3IU0IgKwIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Rmk-w3UdLDkVHB5abXZnCg.jpeg?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*msyRC-dOz9TXyW9HPlCK6A.jpeg?q=20', 'https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/140/140/1*TulxsnMl7VJuGMwVeVeeDQ.jpeg']",https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/152/152/1*sHhtYhaCe2Uc3IU0IgKwIQ.png,[],['Robert Crane'],https://medium.com/@bobcrane_55517/breaking-news-fbi-uncovers-evidence-that-62-million-trump-voters-are-all-russian-agents-bc33994a4286,Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents,[],1500296767.681,https://medium.com,
97,https://web.archive.org/web/20170625123252/https://www.tdtalliance.com/jefferson-davis-statue-replaced-obama-likeness/,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.

As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.

“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.

The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.

“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”

The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.

Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.

Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.

“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”

Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”

As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.

98,http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2012/11/06/112-year-old-voters-in-north-carolina,"Early voting began in North Carolina in October, and soon after almost 900 voters aged 112 reportedly cast ballots. In fact in 2008, almost 10,000 108-year olds cast ballots and just over 9,000 110-year olds voted in 2010.

Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections.

The true explanation is much less exciting.

Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.","['http://www.pewtrusts.org/assets/img/icon-search.png', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2022/01/howtheusgovernment_1x1.jpg?h=317&w=317&la=en&hash=215FB1E5049F080BD71C5ED472F14EF0', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2022/01/two-greater-male-sage-grouse---web-image-size-template/16x9_m.jpg?h=180&w=320&la=en&hash=971546586706269C5847B02923FC8403', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2022/01/gettyimages494386424jpgmaster/16x9_m.jpg?h=180&w=320&la=en&hash=7AA99B813FB915E5F2E92F662B8B86F4', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1833360170048391&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=230521&fmt=gif', 'https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/files/favicon.ico', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2021/02/agendaforamerica/ianhutchinsonu8wfirpsq7yunsplashjpgmaster/16x9_m.jpg?h=380&w=676&la=en&hash=AF9807566C2A551411A255E73EABAD23', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2022/01/gettyimages1220067952jpgmaster/16x9_m.jpg?h=180&w=320&la=en&hash=9A3C7954B5178C4BACE4E24B5F7E21A7', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2022/01/broadbandbasics_thumbnail_700x700px.jpg?h=317&w=317&la=en&hash=05A1B4C4D683CDB87184B26B9B960FD9', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2021/03/ianhutchinsonu8wfirpsq7yunsplashjpgmaster/1x1_s.jpg?h=615&w=615&la=en&hash=126B0A3F79C2BDC15732D65DDE5083BA', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2022/01/cward201323903editjpgmaster/16x9_m.jpg?h=180&w=320&la=en&hash=9188F0D0D3C1F1D3AA1A4A12A45D8E31', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/files/digital_logo_v3.png?h=88&w=244&la=en&hash=C75994F6528C649BAE4F809B4D0D39EB', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2021/12/2btaf5mjpgmaster/1x1_s.jpg?h=317&w=317&la=en&hash=3AC8762CDB3EF2D5ACCEFCC0332B8F76', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2017/05/after_the_fact_woman_car_mirror/16x9_s.jpg?h=380&w=676&la=en&hash=16D929B5B300153E8870ED535812F566', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/2021/02/agendaforamerica/ianhutchinsonu8wfirpsq7yunsplashjpgmaster/16x9_m.jpg?h=346&w=615&la=en&hash=65CC9F7B4E046420D7AEA27904127D00', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/files/pew-footer-logo.png?h=102&w=842&la=en&hash=F4C522D868E5175417B50D1B6278F195', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/post-launch-images/trust-magazine/fall-2021/web-images/cover/cover_promoimage16x9.jpg?h=380&w=676&la=en&hash=99DEA0F722D13549FB57C1147453A378']",https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/files/favicon.ico,[],[],https://www.pewtrusts.org/research-and-analysis/articles/2012/11/06/112-year-old-voters-in-north-carolina,112-Year-Old Voters in North Carolina?,[],1352131200.0,http://www.pewtrusts.org,

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

- It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.

Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.

Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.

Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.

""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].

102,https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427/http://patriotcrier.com:80/1-6kk-0,"ELDER PATRIOT – New evidence has been uncovered by a private investigator that proves Jim Comey was a dirty cop who had to go.

After former DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered his family asked people to stop speculating about his involvements and to respect their privacy.

At the time many of us connected the Wikileaks revelations to his death and concluded he was killed to send a message to other would be leakers by people within the DNC or from within the Clinton campaign. Of course we were dismissed as conspiracy theorists.





Now it has been reported that former D.C. homicide detective Rod Wheeler had been hired by Rich’s family to run a parallel investigation to the one being conducted by the F.B.I.

Both the D.C. police and the F.B.I. had been involved but Wheeler revealed that neither, “The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming. They haven’t been cooperating at all.

Wheeler also confirmed that his sources have told him that “absolutely” there is information on Rich’s laptop that links Rich to Wikileaks.

Wheeler also was told by his source inside the D.C. Police Department, “Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.”

According to Wheeler, “That is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor’s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out.” [Tuesday].

It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement but the fact is the F.B.I. has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three.

Comey’s contention that the DNC server contained proof that Russia hackers affected the election is falling apart as we watch the mad scramble that is ensuing following the recent ransomware attacks.

In explained the ransomware attack, experts are shooting holes in Comey’s claim that the F.B.I. is capable of tracking attacks backwards.

Hector Monsegur, Director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Labs and a former computer hacker who had been arrested by the FBI informant before turning informant said:

“Attribution is probably the hardest thing the FBI is dealing with here.”

“It’s nearly impossible because you have various hackers from pretty much anywhere. Also, they are aware of techniques to track them down. So you could have an Egyptian hacker who uses Russian software so it looks like it’s Russian but is actually from Egypt.”

Comey was definitive that Russia had hacked the DNC’s computers with the intention of helping Donald Trump get elected. Here’s what we’ve learned since Comey made that declaration to congress:

The F.B.I. never did a forensic examination of the DNC servers. Instead they took the word of the company the DNC hired to look into it.

Experts, ones who worked for the F.B.I., admit that attribution is nearly impossible even if you are in possession of the computers that were hacked.

Comey “concluded” that Hillary Clinton did not intend to commit espionage despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary but that the Russians intended to help Donald Trump without presenting a single shred of evidence that the Russians were even involved.

Revelations such as this continue to surface. They are the reason that former Federal Prosecutor Joseph DiGenova said of Comey, “he’s a dirty cop.”

Comey had to go and President Trump did the right thing in firing him. Contrary to the talking points coming out of the D.C. swamp, Trump gave Comey every opportunity to prove his fealty to the law once he had been freed from the constraints put on him by Obama and Loretta Lynch. When Comey continued protecting known criminal behavior to save the swamp he left Donald Trump no choice but to fire him.

America deserves an F.B.I. director who is determined to prosecute criminal behavior no matter where he finds it.",['https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427im_/http://patriotcrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seth-rich-2.jpg'],https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427im_/http://patriotcrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seth-rich-2.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427/http://patriotcrier.com/1-6kk-0/,"BOMBSHELL: COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY",[],1494955317.0,https://web.archive.org,

Trump told the crowd the following: “Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”

Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.

President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.

Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.

Here is what Chaffetz said:

“President Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Here’s what he said: ‘You do a great job. Listen, I understand I’m the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Don’t slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.’ If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of ‘don’t slow down,’ I think was a good message.”

WATCH:

The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clinton’s email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasn’t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.

Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. It’s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she won’t make it out of this investigation so easily.

106,forums.spacebattles.com/threads/%E2%80%9Cgay-people-should-wear-specially-colored-clothes-to-warn-straight-people%E2%80%9D.362660/,"Televangelist Pat Robertson recently repeated his prediction that LGBT rights will provoke God to destroy America’s financial markets, warning “The 700 Club” viewers that God’s wrath is on its way. He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”



“Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”



At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”



“I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.



The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.



“I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.



“I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago. And I am appalled by it.”","['http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11633848775/309536-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11475034169/88882-s.jpg', 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wj7yDOPBh5Q/maxresdefault.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11621845030/58229-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/styles/sbforums/smilies/rolleyes.gif', 'http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/domains/jewishmuseum.org.uk/local/media/images/medium/new%20squared%20images/star.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11609855179/311890-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11335603402/1668-s.jpg', 'https://forums.spacebattles.com/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png?v=69wyvmQdJN', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11563772281/7957-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11362883122/14692-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11628619508/106079-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11553452194/7574-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11337349710/11518-m.jpg', 'https://forums.spacebattles.com/data/logos/Winner/SB/SBLogoFinalSBSH13BOG.png', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'https://i.imgur.com/91sn32Q.jpg?fb', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11335907102/30781-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11543469744/283549-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11623360720/41261-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11630975400/284902-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11362714389/102760-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11617404436/313867-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11556843320/77046-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11531051931/6327-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11586649682/78199-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11636098028/313535-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11427896557/54482-m.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11523313939/861-s.jpg', 'http://forums.spacebattles.com/data/avatar/11351045670/283294-m.jpg']",https://forums.spacebattles.com/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png?v=69wyvmQdJN,[],[],https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/%E2%80%9Cgay-people-should-wear-specially-colored-clothes-to-warn-straight-people%E2%80%9D.362660/,“Gay People Should Wear Specially-Colored Clothes To Warn Straight People”,[],1446663783.0,http://forums.spacebattles.com,

Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with “radical” positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.

“I don’t know what you’re talking – I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That’s what I believe,” declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. “I believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that’s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,” Rubio asserted.



Taking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would “put rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.”

“I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it,” Rubio said. “I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on.”

He added: “That is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.”

Asked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: “Don’t know yet, first thing’s first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.”/SOURCE

He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.

When asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was “proud” he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because “scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.” Asked to elaborate, he said that he was “glad” to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, “disappointed” as to where he was assigned. “While I can certainly appreciate President Trump’s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can’t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,” he said. “I do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they’re just wasting their time.”

“When I get back home from work – believe me – I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,” Clovis continued. “I’m proud I’m not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they can’t see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, that’s a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? They’re the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. They’re so narrow-minded that they can’t except that we’re different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. It’s funny when you really think about it.”

“That’s why I’m happy I’m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don’t even consider the fact that there’s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It’s as funny as it is pitiful,” he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump’s pick for top scientist if that’s how he feels about it, he replied, “Well, just because you’re a member of the Trump administration doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,” Clovis concluded.

110,https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929/https://www.veterantv.com/trump-removing-marines-from-the-navy/,"President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of the Marine Corps, freeing the Marines from the Department of The Navy. The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare.

Since 1834 The Marines have fallen under the Department of the Navy. This has always been a thorn in the side of Marines and naturally a source of ridicule from other branches. In 1834 Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service. The Marines will improve their amphibious attack readiness, and will continue to use the Navy for transportation to be the “First to Fight”.

The Marines will have an entirely new ROE and mission. Marine units that don’t accomplish the mission within the 2 month window will be reassigned by the Marine Corps, and will have to watch as another unit finishes the job. “The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia.” Sgt Major Garrett explained.

The move is mainly sentimental since the President has a clear love of The Marines and their traditions. “The Marines have dedicated their lives to the service of this country and have served at the pleasure of the President for many, many years and it’s about time they be recognized as a separate department. They are the President’s own and shall remain as such.” President Trump explained.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/covfefe-80x69.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-marines.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-icons-widget/icons/medium/facebook.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-icons-widget/icons/medium/instagram.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bro-love-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-icons-widget/icons/medium/youtube.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/2565357/0bf02946-1243-444d-8e4b-32cec2386db5.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2565357/trump%20marines.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1347215522010472&ev=PageView&noscript=1&cd[domain]=www.veterantv.com', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1347215522010472&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1347215522010472&ev=GeneralEvent&noscript=1&cd[post_type]=post&cd[content_name]=Trump+Removing+Marines+From+the+Navy&cd[post_id]=3384&cd[content_category]=Featured%2C+Satire&cd[domain]=www.veterantv.com', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/VET-Television-logo-blank-back-white-300x169.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929im_/https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-marines.jpg,[],['Jesse James'],https://web.archive.org/web/20200709064929/https://www.veterantv.com/trump-removing-marines-from-the-navy/,Trump Removing Marines From the Navy,[],1495755914.0,https://web.archive.org,

Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump.

Baio’s wife, Raylene, wasn’t on the plane but was checked into St Timothy’s on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldn’t be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was “really special as Chachi” and he “sure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.”

Baio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento he’s been sporting.

Baio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasn’t personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh:

“The President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once ‘Chachi.’ He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet.”

To clear it up, libtards, he would probably send the company jet and not Air Force One. Maybe one of the smaller planes like the Secretary of State gets but nothing bigger than that. Baio’s remains are scattered with the wreckage, with slammed nose first into a cliff face. The FCC said the pilot probably got disoriented in a cloud bank and came at a 30-degree downward angle directly into solid quartz with a touch of limestone. The plane fell nearly 1400 feet to the basin below where very little was recognizable.

Baio had no known connection to the Clintons — Trey Gowdy is investigating.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/obama-administration-wont-name-islamic-terror-191x120.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/breaking-191x120.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/22-28-191x120.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855im_/https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chachi1.jpg?resize=510%2C287', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/plane3.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/plane3.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170625173855/http://dailyusaupdate.com/scott-baio-beloved-face-conservatism-dies-small-plane-crash-way-visit-trump/,"Scott Baio, Beloved Face Of Conservatism, Dies In Small Plane Crash On His Way To Visit Trump",[],1496280782.0,https://web.archive.org,
112,worldnewsdailyreport.com/bin-laden-is-alive-and-well-in-the-bahamas-says-edward-snowden/,"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.

Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.

According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.

“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”

Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.

“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”

Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.

Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.

The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.

On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.","['https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/saudibacon-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psmmurders-120x67.jpg', 'http://worldnewsdailyreport.com//worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden3.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squirrelman3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flamegame-120x67.jpg', 'http://worldnewsdailyreport.com//worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden2.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oldalienprobes-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afghansheep-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mormon3-180x101.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/82ca146269e7bf43f00d0c126f508659?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rushmorerescue-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mermaidrape3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mugbadmother-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brosis-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/slaughter-180x101.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2f7e2ac0b8aeafc09859f2540e018a5b?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voodoohairdresser-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/manurevilla2-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pizzaman-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TSAflashlight-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deadmother-120x67.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e2ae36088db4e8b67b4737353b26c47?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8788f441ed10ec58b872789f13a13365?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/missouri-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/themes/mh_newsdesk/images/factsdontmatter3.png']",https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowden.jpg,[],['Barbara Jennnings'],https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/bin-laden-is-alive-and-well-in-the-bahamas-says-edward-snowden/,"Bin Laden is “Alive and well in the Bahamas”, says Edward Snowden",[],1440514081.0,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com,

Conspiracy theorists have sparked fears over an apocalyptic collision between Jupiter and Venus, set to plunge Earth into 15 days of darkness this month.

Just when you thought it couldn’t get darker or colder outside, the fear-mongering conspiracy theorists are here to tell you you’re wrong…

Advert 10

If you can suspend reality long enough to believe Jupiter and Venus will collide on Monday in an ‘astronomical’ space collision and subsequent global blackout, just because they said so in their falsified NASA statement.

ESO

According to the identity stealing so-called experts, writing on the website Dinos Mark as well as Reflection of Mind, the two brightest planets in our solar system will crash into each other and could even be visible from the naked eye.

The far-fetched claim continued:

Advert 10

According to the [NASA] report, Venus and Jupiter will engaged in a close parallelism, only being separated by one degree.

NASA

Now, to fan the flames of this fabricated fire, some clever cloggs has even gone as far as to publish a false statement.

The statement purported to be written by NASA official Charles Boden – who must be pretty angry right now – ‘confirmed’ the world would be plunged into darkness from November 15 and November 29.

Advert 10

NASA

The statement read:

NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2017. The event, according to NASA, hasn’t occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the ‘November Black Out’ event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter.

Advert 10

The internet hoax isn’t news, with many liars claiming darkness will descend in some New World Order extra-terrestrial scam.

NASA has denied it will happen time and time again, stating in over one million years, an event like this has never occurred.

The overactive imaginations of conspiracy theorists must be commended, but perhaps next time, put it into a work of science fiction rather than try and pass it off as a NASA-confirmed fact.

Meanwhile, on the Internet, other theorists are gearing up for their psychic predictions for 2018, like Craig Hamilton-Parker, the self-proclaimed modern day Nostradamus.

A self-proclaimed prophet, who wants to seemingly shatter your dreams, hopes and aspirations for next year with his special potion of unproven alarm and fear-mongering mysticism.

Hamilton-Parker, who shares all his best work on YouTube and psychics.com from his home in Southampton, foresees a US attack on North Korea, a chemical attack on a European city and an attempt to impeach Trump.

He doesn’t reveal his sources, but it seems he’s really keeping up with current affairs in his mission to pull predictions out of his backside.

For 2018 he’s bookmarked in his calendar the following world crises: US forces striking North Korea by blowing up a key trade route, Kim Jong-un being overthrown by his own people, a failed attempt to impeach Donald Trump and the sinking of a US warship.

The good news is there’s absolutely no proof this guy has any more insight into what’s going to happen to the global political and social climate in 2018, than he does into what I’m going to have for my dinner.","['https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F04%2FGettyImages-635058398.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fomicron.png', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F02%2F711-nasa-exoplanets-fb.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/assets/unilad-logo.662cbe64da699fce9ed24612da8cbd4b.png', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-mGfuu1G9VdsCs.gif', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2FVEGAN.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F800px-SDOs_Ultra-high_Definition_View_of_2012_Venus_Transit_304_Angstrom_Full_Disc_02.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=70,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=crop,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fpeep-potter.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2FJupiter-Juno-Mission_2.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F03%2F1321-GettyImages-655932452.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=jzgkj1aAkN00Ej', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2FSpace-Globe-Earth-Moon-Solar-System-Orbit-Planet-581239.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=70,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=crop,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fboba-fett-ship.jpeg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=contain,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2Fnasa-venus-web.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=70,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=crop,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fbelly-dancing.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=70,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=crop,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fchina.png', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15593740&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fdesnardboreout1.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=648,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2Fprediction-2018-web.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fandrewcaseskele.jpg', 'https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=70,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=crop,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F01%2Fmetal.png']","https://www.unilad.co.uk/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=contain,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unilad.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2Fnasa-venus-web.jpg",[],['Francesca Donovan'],https://www.unilad.co.uk/science/nasa-confirms-15-days-of-darkness-coming-this-month/,‘NASA Confirms’ 15 Days Of Darkness Coming This Month,[],,https://www.unilad.co.uk,

United States President, Donald Trump, says he looks forward to working with the administration of Prime Minister, the Most Hon. Andrew Holness, on bilateral and regional issues.

The President made the comment during a courtesy call paid on him by Jamaica’s Ambassador to the United States, Her Excellency Audrey Marks, at the Oval Office in the White House.

During their discourse, Mr Trump and Ambassador Marks underscored the strong longstanding bond of friendship between the people Jamaica and the United States of America, while noting the island’s contribution in many spheres of American life.

Ms Marks said she looked forward to working with the President in the interest of both countries, and highlighted the synergies of the US-Caribbean nexus cementing the relationship between the nations.

The Ambassador, in noting the President’s agenda of providing more trading opportunities for US companies, called attention to the significant trade surplus the North American country enjoys in the Caribbean.

She highlighted the fact that the region is the United States’ seventh largest trading partner, importing non-oil goods and services valued over US$50 billion.

This, she said, placed the region ahead of U.S. exports to comparatively larger economies such as Russia and India combined.

Ms Marks further noted the mutual benefit and alignment of interest for the continued stability and economic growth of the Caribbean which she described as the United States’ ‘third border’.

The Jamaican envoy also took the opportunity to invite President Trump to visit Jamaica in his official capacity.","['https://jis.gov.jm/media/2019/11/Ananda-Alert.jpg', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/2021/10/COVID-19-Vaccination-1.jpg', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/2022/01/YHP_0671-1024x684.jpg?v=1641942420', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/2018/10/jis-logo-icon-color.png', 'https://jis.gov.jm/wp-content/themes/jis/img/side-menu.png', 'http://jis.gov.jm/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/flags/24/en.png', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/2022/01/nomination-form.jpeg', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/9-470x290.png', 'http://jis.gov.jm/media/favicon.png', 'https://jis.gov.jm/wp-content/themes/jis/img/width-fix.png', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/2020/03/corona-virus-ad.jpg', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/SPRING-VALLEY-TOWN-HALL-2017-36-2-470x290.jpg', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/IMG_0930-1-670x450.jpg', 'https://jis.gov.jm/wp-content/themes/jis/img/goj-header.png', 'https://jis.gov.jm/media/JapanXedit-470x290.jpg']",http://jis.gov.jm/media/favicon.png,[],[],https://jis.gov.jm/president-trump-underscores-us-jamaica-relations/,President Trump Underscores US-Jamaica Relations – Jamaica Information Service,[],,http://jis.gov.jm,

Pundits were quick to capitalise on her comments and tell her that if she and her boss were doing a good job and being open and honest with the American people then she wouldn’t have to face much criticism.

“Making ridiculous claims that she’s being hated because of her good looks is as ridiculous as it gets. The American people don’t care if she looks like a model or not. All they want is to see her doing a good job and not spinning facts around,” wrote James Collin, a New York based attorney and registered Democrat.

Kellyanne Conway’s comments have caused reactions on social media especially on Twitter where she has been blasted as “a show off and trying to divert attention from the most important issues facing our country.”

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suffered what her staff is calling a “breakdown” this morning and was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda. Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, head of psychiatry, said Pelosi shows signs of a psychotic break from reality that a woman her age may never recover from:

“Mrs. Pelosi is in an advanced stage of disengagement from reality. She’s under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.”

Well that’s just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there won’t be any winning for them. They’ll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.

Real Patriots who love their president. No. Matter.

120,dailybuzzlive.com/cannibals-arrested-florida/,"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.","['http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53bdb25ab304f0f972e13559df508f67?s=75&d=identicon&r=pg', 'http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Tools.png', 'http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Basement-Fridge.png', 'http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Home.png', 'http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/SPLAT-LOLO1.png', 'http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Basement.png', 'http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibals.png']",http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibals.png,[],['Daily Buzz Live'],http://dailybuzzlive.com/cannibals-arrested-florida/,Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression,[],1617640791.0,http://dailybuzzlive.com,

Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.

This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as they’re told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibusters…either get in line of get out.

One of these days the Democrats will realize they can’t keep up with the winning strategy of the Republican party. It doesn’t matter how many more votes the Dems get, the GOP continues to grow stronger. With Schumer out of the way it will grow even stronger. The alleged file on Franken includes things like pushing entitlement programs that are meant to give away free stuff for votes and adultery.

President Trump doesn’t mess around.

122,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-of-american-moon-landings/,"Beijing | Top officials of the Chinese Space Program have come out this week and expressed their skepticism that the American Moon landings ever happened, reports the Beijing Daily Express.

More than 2,000 high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party have signed a petition this week asking explanations from the American government concerning the American Moon landings after doubts arose that the Apollo Moon landings ever happened.

These allegations have come up after recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese Chang’e-4 probe allegedly found no traces of the American Moon landings existing on the Moon.

Several high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party even stated publicly that these latest findings proved without a doubt that the Moon landings were an “elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the world about America’s space program capabilities”.

Russia’s top astrophysicist, Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin, has also made a public statement this week claiming that the Russian government “had always been aware of the situation since the early 1970’s”

These recent allegations have given credence to conspiracy theorists who have been claiming for decades that America has never gone to the Moon.

Conspiracy theorists believe that president Richard Nixon pushed the agenda of a fake Apollo program to fool USSR into the Space Race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining the USSR.

The Apollo program was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972.

No other country has since landed a human on the Moon, although several countries, such as Russia and China, are expected to plan missions beyond 2030.","['https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/boypuppy-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/saudibacon-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psmmurders-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squirrelman3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flamegame-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oldalienprobes-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afghansheep-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/miner-180x101.png', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rushmorerescue-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mermaidrape3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brosis-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chinamoonofficial.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voodoohairdresser-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/manurevilla2-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pizzaman-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/apollo-11-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TSAflashlight-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deadmother-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/themes/mh_newsdesk/images/factsdontmatter3.png', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nasaadmin-180x101.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/652bd1a45984f0d42865d6629125cfd1?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chinamoon.jpg']",https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chinamoon.jpg,[],['Bob Flanagan'],https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-of-american-moon-landings/,Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American Moon landings,[],1546629946.0,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com,

Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.

Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.

When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.

The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.

The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.

Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon — even in fatalities.

San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that ""we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident."" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was ""exploring all options with respect to those charges.""",['https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1d78d18d18c0e71d5c7c4a0350b598687f50fe1/c=0-50-534-352/local/-/media/2015/04/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635658253473314189-635658099473288454-AP584562209482.jpg?width=534&height=302&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp'],https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1d78d18d18c0e71d5c7c4a0350b598687f50fe1/c=0-50-534-352/local/-/media/2015/04/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635658253473314189-635658099473288454-AP584562209482.jpg?width=534&height=302&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,[],[],https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/04/28/bumble-bee-foods-tuna-worker-cooked/26517161/,,[],1430150400.0,http://www.usatoday.com,

According to various sources, FBI Director James Comey might soon be replaced by the Trump Administration. Even better, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is already being touted as Comey’s successor, via US Defense Watch.

For those unaware of Gowdy’s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now.

More recently, Representative Gowdy has been a voice of reason regarding the Democrat fixation on the idea of President Trump’s supposed connections to Vladimir Putin. He’s even gone on record defending California Republican Devin Nunes from Democrat attacks on his integrity and his ability to properly investigate whether Obama spied on Trump during the 2016 campaign, via Townhall.

A long-time favorite of the Tea Party and other conservative groups, Gowdy is the type of man the Trump Administration needs to clean up the leftovers of the Obama Administration and its “Deep State” allies.

His little stand-up routine, that wasn’t funny, has now landed him in the back of a black SUV on the way to a federal holding facility for questioning.

“People just assume he was kidding. What they don’t know is that Depp actually had maps and timetables and plans to assassinate President Trump if he ever visited Concord, New Hampshire again, which he certainly would during the 2020 general election season. Depp is a dangerous criminal. Some of the content on his computer indicate that he may have been radicalized while he was studying in Muslim waters for his Captain Jack Sparrow role.”

There you have it. If they find out that Depp is a Muslim convert with plans to kill the President he may never see the light of day again. It’s difficult to think of our favorite actors as such horrible people sometimes, but Hollywood is just filled with tree-hugging, self-righteous, Prius driving freaks. H/T: thelastlineofdefense

Skip Tetheluda, whose jerky has landed more than a few exclusive interviews, says Argueta was told to take Depp deep and dark into the night, make sure they weren’t followed and bring him for advanced interrogation.

126,https://www.inverse.com/article/21717-leonardo-dicaprio-barack-obama-elon-musk-mars-trio-sxsl,"Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real.

Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama.

DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.

The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.”

“The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.”

As Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.”

Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.

“I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile.

It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.

It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying.

Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.","['https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?w=350&h=298&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&blend=000000&blendAlpha=45&blendMode=normal', 'https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg', 'https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/5a/29/a2/38/95d5/4f29/b651/149229562bb3/president-barack-obamadr-katharine-hayhoe-and-leonardo-dicaprio-talk-climate-change.png?w=349&h=142&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif']",https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg,[],[],https://www.inverse.com/article/21717-leonardo-dicaprio-barack-obama-elon-musk-mars-trio-sxsl,Leonardo DiCaprio Tells President Obama That He's Going to Mars,['https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbgM8Ksq4kc'],,https://www.inverse.com,

130,https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142109/http://stgeorgegazette.com:80/trump-plans-to-resign-within-30-days,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days.

“Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,” Ryan told reporters. “Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.”







News of this comes as Russia’s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.

“If the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,” Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. “Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.”

Donald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.

“We did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you’ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!”

“We think this is the best thing,” Ryan continued. “He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it’s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.”

After word spread of Trump’s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.







“I think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he’s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.”

Lloyd Glacier, a spokesman for ‘Sock It Forward‘, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump’s plan to resign.

“This will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.”

38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.

“When I’m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,” Horner said. “Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it’s all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased. Just an FYI, you’re all going to burn in Hell for eternity, but Jesus loves you very much! Praise Fappy!”

The Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments about Trump’s impending resignation. That hotline’s phone number is (785) 273-0329.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142109im_/http://stgeorgegazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/My-Life-Optic-218x150.jpg',

These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can’t accept defeat, but that doesn’t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?

According to our exclusive sources, Comey and Wasserman Schultz met while both working for the government, and despite the fact that both of them are married, they couldn’t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they’re two liberal sickos — and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them.

And now we all know the REAL reason that the sad ex-FBI Director Comey is trying to attack Donald Trump… to impress his GIRLFRIEND!

Pathetic.

Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has “sanctioned” violence, as long it protects the “people favorable to the Obama position, politically.” She insisted that the president is sending “a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don’t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.” She also linked the Obama administration’s “lawlessness” to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving “normal” people helpless in the face of anarchy.

“And these days it has become so obvious that I’m honestly surprised we’re not having riots throughout the country,” she said. “When did this become a nation of criminals? I didn’t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I’m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.”

The ex-Rep. then argued that “not even slaves” suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. “It’s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I’m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear – we’re supposed to be all evolved right now, we’re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He’s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you’ve seen in Minneapolis.”

“In fact,” Bachmann continued firing, “I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama’s presidency.” She added, “Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does.”

“And let’s get one thing straight – I’m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I’d be saying the same thing all over again,” Bachmann quipped. “That’s what I’m trying to point out – white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I’m seriously worried whether or not we’ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we’re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we’ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another – white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves.

Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

“The funny thing,” a White House official said, “is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.”

“But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,” he went on, “no one in the press would say it was her staffs’ fault.”

That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.

Canadian tourist, John O’Keef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.

“We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head” explains O’Keef.

“I’d heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,” claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist.

The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.

Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: “This is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.

According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.

U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.

In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","['https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resurect-350x199.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/background-1.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/logo-2.png', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sexdenmark-1-350x199.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan-2.jpg', 'https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ar15shortage-350x199.jpg']",https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg,[],[],https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/,"3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes",[],1466516497.0,https://notallowedto.com,

Fareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.

Zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.

“The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.

Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”

The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.

CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.

“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.

1. One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.

2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.

3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.

4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.

5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.

6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.

7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.

8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.

139,https://halfwaypost.com/2017/07/06/white-house-chef-quits-because-trump-has-only-eaten-fast-food-for-6-months/,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.

Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.

“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”

Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.

“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”

Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.

“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”

No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.

Privilege. Obama and his pals liked to call it “white privilege,” but they really can’t in this case, can they? In this case the daughter of a president was moved to the front of the line.

It didn’t last long, however, because just like at home, Malia has issues with staying out of trouble. She was caught, by Embassy Security — aka the US Marines — on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador’s carrier pigeons. Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist.

Malia was terminated immediately, her room was cleared and she was escorted from the private areas of the embassy to the common area where she could wait to change the dates on her travel visa so she could return home. She was last seen in the lobby when a black SUV pulled up out front and she willingly got in. Looks like Daddy probably saved the day again.

No word now on Malia’s next move. She won’t be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government, since all government jobs require drug tests. Maybe she can go to work with her benevolent father collecting huge speaking fees for destroying the country.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/http://freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/malia.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/https://i2.wp.com/freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-8.54.10-PM.png?resize=80%2C60', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e4a67ab253be612c1eb6b4b4b69aea78?s=125&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/https://i0.wp.com/freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/trump-pointing.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/http://freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wheaties-satire.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/http://freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-alol-cover.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/https://i1.wp.com/freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/malia.jpg?resize=678%2C381']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006im_/http://freedomcrossroads.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/malia.jpg,[],"['About The Potatriot', 'The Potatriot Is A Constitutional Conservative The Constitutional Republic Of The United States.']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170702174006/http://freedomcrossroads.us/malia-obama-fired-from-cushy-internship-at-spanish-embassy/,Malia Obama Fired From Cushy Internship At Spanish Embassy,[],1498731083.0,https://web.archive.org,

Their entire lives are shrouded in mystery, murder, deception and crime. They wouldn’t know the truth if it bit them in the hiney. In the case of Slick Willy’s secret airplane meeting with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the secret was supposedly already out.

Not true, says a reporter for the Baltimore Morning News, who has obtained a copy of a paperwork required by the state of Maryland intended to be a backup system to terrorism checks for private planes. In this case, the information logged showed that Loretta Lynch and one passenger made the trip that ended with the meeting in the hangar that both Clinton and Lynch say was a happenstance encounter with no substance.

So…who was the passenger? With no point of origin paperwork or public flight plan needed for someone with such high clearance, the only evidence is the Maryland manifest, which says the former AG showed up to meet with Bill Clinton accompanied by Speaker Paul Ryan.

What would Paul Ryan, Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton be doing meeting in July, before the election, in a hangar outside of Baltimore? Theories are beginning to mount but the feeling is that Bill Clinton was negotiating for his wife and the DNC, while Ryan was looking out for the RNC and Lynch was the mediator. They were most likely conspiring to throw a wrench in the juggernaut that was the trump campaign. It didn’t work.

The other possibility is that they made a deal for Hillary’s freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss. Would Hillary Clinton sacrifice the Democrat party, which is now basically defunct, for a few years of freedom before she finally gags on her own sins and dies? You bet she would.

Now the question is: Did anyone do anything illegal? Ryan certainly could face an investigation into his professional ethics if nothing else. He’s the Speaker of the House. He doesn’t make policy, he leads the body that makes policy. Big difference.

On Friday's Shepard Smith Reporting, the host launched into a tirade over Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing even as new details showed it included eight people. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.

""We're still not clean on this, Chris,"" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. ""Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.""

Smith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.

""The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.""

The diatribe left Wallace speechless.

""I don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.""

Smith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.

Smith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as ""not fake news,"" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.

Convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius was, according to reports, rushed to a local state hospital in the early hours of Saturday after he allegedly attempted on his life.

Although information is still sketchy, a social media report claimed that the former Paralympic athlete had injured his wrists in his prison cell.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital.

According to City Press, correctional services said Pistorius claimed he had injured himself after falling out of bed.

“An inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally,” the news report stated.

The report added that sharp blades were subsequently found in Pistorius’ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.

The reports could not yet be confirmed.

Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prison’s health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent. A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.

The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”

Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”

Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”

“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”

Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”

“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-6G2CQMn_jcjgR.gif', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/maxresdefault-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/091313_GretchenFarewell-645x325.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6021441883564&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ted-And-Heidi-Cruz-1-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/maxresdefault-1-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/091313_GretchenFarewell-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/23158392405_d3e3b60cb8_o-150x150.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146im_/http://therightists.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/091313_GretchenFarewell-150x150.jpg,[],['Eli The'],https://web.archive.org/web/20160620202146/http://therightists.com/gretchen-carlson-the-2nd-amendment-was-written-before-guns-were-invented/,Gretchen Carlson: “The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented”,[],,https://web.archive.org,

With Election Day close and a Donald Trump presidency appearing increasingly likely , some of Hollywood's left-leaning stars are preparing to emigrate to the country up north if things go sour for them.

""Breaking Bad"" actor Bryan Cranston is the latest celebrity to suggest that he would leave the US for Canada in the event of a Trump victory in Tuesday's election.

He joins the likes of Barbara Streisand, Chelsea Handler, and several others who are planning to cross the border into the land of liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau should Hillary Clinton lose.

Barack Obama is a sick human being unfit for any political office past, present, or future. Just like ultra left-wing Bernie Sanders supporter Caitlin Johnstone, Obama (Barry Soetoro as he was known in college while he was doing sexual favors for old men to get cocaine money) attacked a recovering John McCain viciously Wednesday night then deleted the tweet like a coward.

“John McCain is NOT a war hero,” our Muslim former “President” said, adding that “if there were any god in heaven” the Senator would have died from his brain tumor.

Obama had previously tweeted out well wishings at 8:49 p.m. and apparently accidentally sent his REAL feelings (seemingly intended for a private message) which he quickly hid from the world.

The tweet was deleted within two minutes but was already shared by more than 73,000 liberals who want nothing more than to see someone who has served our country die in agony.He even brought God’s name into it.

Obama has repeatedly attacked our servicemen for more than eight years, doing more damage to them than ISIS and al Qaeda combined according to a study done by the Freedom Coalition for Conservative Values

You have to realize that liberals like Obama pledged themselves to Satan long ago and are nothing but a bunch of idiot lowlifes.

Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted his thoughts and prayers to McCain because they are Christians who love everyone even if they have had their differences in the past:

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”

The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”

Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”

Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.

Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”

Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.

Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018

Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.","['https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/865/643/6637840f668010e928c95f2cf3a80403e4-18-goodlatte.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg', 'http://nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg', 'http://nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg', 'https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/865/643/6637840f668010e928c95f2cf3a80403e4-18-goodlatte.rsquare.w700.jpg', 'http://nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg', 'https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8c4/cfa/b18bb5334731fc2705fa612a2e88d7e00c-0122-cover-rikers-4x5-rev.w240.jpg']",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/865/643/6637840f668010e928c95f2cf3a80403e4-18-goodlatte.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,[],['Margaret Hartmann'],https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/fbi-agent-peter-strzok-will-testify-before-congress.html,"Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress",[],1529312677.365,http://nymag.com,
149,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651,"An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

A hearing is slated for August 21.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

It almost seems fitting that the last thing she hears is a lie about her own well-being.

The Butcher of Benghazi will meet her maker, says Doctor Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as the damage to her heart is irreparable at this point:

“Secretary Clinton fought hard but today her fight is over. We predict she’ll be at rest within hours.”

The Clinton family has asked for privacy and wouldn’t answer questions about whether or not they had to decide to “pull the plug” or if they’re simply being told nothing can be done. Chelsea Clinton was seen entering the hospital in tears shortly after noon, according to a new report from LLOD correspondent Skip Tetheluda:

“Chelsea came alone and was obviously distraught. She made no comment to the press but did stop to tell one photographer to have some respect while she ‘visits a great woman for the last time.’ She hasn’t come out and is presumably sitting and waiting to say goodbye. Bill Clinton is sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary.”

We’ll update you as soon as we confirm that Clinton has gone on to answer for her crimes with an eternity in Hell.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-kids-ad-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spicer-hillary-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Schermata-2017-04-01-alle-17.45.45-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spicer-hillary-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maxresdefault-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/linds-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muslims-300x180.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maxresdefault-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-kids-ad-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/miley-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Schermata-2017-04-01-alle-17.45.45-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-inauguration-7-300x180.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/121-300x180.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/schumer-1480760688-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/schumer-1480760688-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/miley-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muslims-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-inauguration-7-80x80.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/111-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/67-300x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/POL2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/57.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag/images/logos/logo-foot.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/111-300x180.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/67-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/linds-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/121-80x80.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/57.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757/http://politicspaper.com/breaking/breaking-hillary-clinton-third-heart-attack-docs-says-wont-survive/,BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Has Third Heart Attack-Docs Says She ‘Won’t Survive’,[],1501280644.0,https://web.archive.org,

An independent source at the Pentagon is confirming for us what the mainstream media won’t until they’ve figured out an angle to make Trump look bad: North Korea’s military is in ruins and not a single civilian was hurt.

The reporter who managed to get the story told LLOD:

“A cute little airman whose name I won’t disclose confirmed that Admiral Fitzwallis gave the order to go to 17 SEAL teams on the ground covertly in North Korea. In three hours time, the entire military infrastructure of that country has been eliminated. This was no joke. This was calculated and perfectly executed. According to the airman, North Korea is brighter now than it ever has been at night because “it is currently on fire.”

Now reports are coming in from sources on the ground in Pyongyang that Supreme Leader and all-around nitwit Kim Jong Un has been killed in the action. Immediately afterward, Kim was spotted on radio giving a death to America speech that was recorded several years ago, but the actual dictator hasn’t been spotted.

From the Presidential Palace, crews are working on a colla[psed section of the building that houses the living quarters of Kim and his family.

We’ll keep you updated on this developing story.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180826192238im_/https://i2.wp.com/usa24info.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/logo-e1487195930329.png?fit=311%2C83', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180826192238im_/https://i2.wp.com/usa24info.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/67.jpg?fit=678%2C381']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180826192238im_/https://i2.wp.com/usa24info.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/67.jpg?fit=678%2C381,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180826192238/http://usa24info.com/index.php/2017/11/09/report-kim-jong-un-killed-trumps-overnight-black-op-attack-north-korea/,REPORT: Kim Jong Un Killed In Trump’s Overnight Black Op Attack On North Korea -,[],1510156800.0,https://web.archive.org,

Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details.

Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday.

“He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.

Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.

In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.

State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.

The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.

Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.

The photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”

Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”

Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”

The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.

“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.

Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”

But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.

The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.

The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.

The car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.

Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.

One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.

“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”

He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”

Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”

Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.

A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: “We’re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.”

Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: “I think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration’s politics and rhetoric.”

Statue controversy

In February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.



It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.

In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.

The media flurry after the confusing happenings in Charlottesville yesterday is fueling violence in this country and it appears that this is exactly what the Dems want.

This is highly suspicious and almost suggests that these people were being hired for the rally in Charlottesville this weekend to impersonate “white nationalists” and incite violence so it would look like they were at fault for the chaos.

Do you think this is a plausible theory? Let us know in the comments!

161,http://www.newscats.org/?p=11110,"Conservative author Dinesh D’Souza uncovered something that blows the Left’s whole narrative to bits. While they have been throwing around claims that the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road is a Republican, D’Souza discovered he actually an Obama-supporting Democrat.

Well, well. The white supremacist organizer of #Charlottesville was an Obama supporter & Occupy Wall Street activist https://t.co/hI5PxNUmb7 — Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 15, 2017

“Rumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler’s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama,” the Southern Poverty Law Center notes in their profile of Kessler.

Kessler didn’t just support Obama; he visited the Oval Office in 2016. Here’s a photo of the two of them having a fun chat:

The Democrat party wants you to forget they are the party of the KKK. The Democrat party wants you to blame Republicans. But let’s remember that socialism is inherently a leftist ideology. Nazis — National Socialists — are leftist, pure and simple.

The Left has no shame in their attempt to link Donald Trump, who repudiated the attacker immediately after the murder occurred, to white supremacists but perhaps they should remember their own party’s history…and its present.

Busted! Journos Rush To Spread Fake News Following Trump’s Latest Press Conference

Donald Trump gave a speech addressing the violence this past weekend in Charlottesville.

During his speech, the President asked if the “alt-left” bore as much responsibility for the chaos as its extremist counterparts on the alt-right. Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.

Politico’s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as “us” in his speech. “Just noticed the use of ‘us’ in this transcript,” wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.

“Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?” she wrongly quoted the president as saying

Speaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the “alt-left” (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.

In the speech, Trump clearly says “Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at ‘em?”

As Karni’s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some—including CNN’s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. “Transcript may be funky,” he wrote.

Others, like New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.

Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.

Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. “Trump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,” wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.

The fake news stems from Politico’s inaccurate transcription of Donald Trump’s speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.

The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction at the bottom.

“In a review of the audio, we could not definitively discern Trump’s exact words at that moment in the news conference,” the site claims. Rather puzzlingly, Politico had no problem peppering “REPORTERS YELL INDISTINCTLY” throughout the piece.","['https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-непрочитанных-чата-5.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bankids-150x147.png', 'https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brian-klaas-deleted-tweet-trump.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/responsive-icon/Follow.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Worse.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/justanad.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-непрочитанных-чата-2.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/35737161_10216568960284877_3910649555019890688_n.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Los-Zetas-Threat-640x480-80x60.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/responsive-icon/facebook.svg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/election-fraud-Pexels-copyright-free-image.jpg', 'https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/politico-archive-charging.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img-5-1.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cropped-Newsfeed-32x32.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/817bcbd302d88f1f.jpeg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-непрочитанных-чата.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image.jpg', 'https://newsfeedobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/loluidiots.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tom-fittons-weekly-update-large.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Race-Wars.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-непрочитанных-чата-2-1.png', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHWXVuBXsAAvOnH.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/refund-police-913x479-1-300x157.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-непрочитанных-чата-4.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Scare-Tactic.png', 'https://www.paypal.com/EN_US/i/scr/pixel.gif', 'https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/annie-karni-trump.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/responsive-icon/Twitter.svg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WOW-The-Steal-Is-On-With-Last-Night-s-Ballot-Dump-Wisconsin-has-88-Voter-Turnout-or-HIGHER-IT-S-EITHER-A-NEW-RECORD-OR-IT-S-HORSESH-T.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/loluidiots-678x381.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-непрочитанных-чата-1.png', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pmfgpf.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Marc-Morano-678x1024-1.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sound-Pressure-Logo.jpg', 'https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/politico-archive-charging-fixed.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Epic-speech-80x60.jpg', 'https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Turmeric-Curcumin-Tumeric-Plant-Spice-Dry-Indian.jpg']",https://usercontent.one/wp/www.newscats.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cropped-Newsfeed-32x32.jpg,[],[],https://www.newscats.org/white-supremacist-who-killed-protester-is-a-democrat-and-visited-obama-in-oval-office/,WHITE SUPREMACIST WHO KILLED PROTESTER IS A DEMOCRAT AND VISITED OBAMA IN OVAL OFFICE (Updated 16.08.2017),['https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvVkHIbU8N0?feature=oembed'],,http://www.newscats.org,

The daughter of legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks.

Trump, who stood side by side with Rosa Parks while she was still alive and received praise for his work improving the community for black youths, recently condemned the violence on “many sides” – both the ironically named “antifa” who showed up to create problems at the “Unite the Right” rally and those who overreacted to the violent Communists attacking them.

For some, this isn’t good enough but Muriel Parks-Rosenberg stepped in on Friday to drop a truth bomb on liberals.

“President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong,” she said in a speech at the Kennedy Center. “He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn.”

“My mother would have been proud of the President’s words,” she told the crowd of about 500 people. “Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back.”",['https://web.archive.org/web/20170823223242im_/http://forfreedomworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/lol-800x445.jpg'],,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170823223242/http://forfreedomworld.com/2017/08/20/breaking-rosa-parks-daughter-praises-trumps-response-to-charlottesville/,BREAKING: Rosa Parks’ Daughter Praises Trump’s Response to Charlottesville – forfreedomworld,[],1503158400.0,https://web.archive.org,

Arpaio, convicted of a bogus charge for doing the job the people of Maricopa County elected him to do, was about to spend the next 12 to 18 months in a federal minimum security prison.

His second pardon of the day, while not as immediately necessary, held just as much meaning. By granting clemency to Kim Davis, the Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, her record will be expunged and her good name reinstated. Davis has been seeing a probation officer monthly since the incident nearly two years ago now to prove she’s in compliance with the judge’s orders.

With her record cleared, she no longer has to check in with anyone or list herself on job, volunteer and credit applications as a criminal. A criminal is the farthest thing from what she is. She’s a conscientious freedom fighter who wouldn’t stand by while her rights were trampled and her very existence threatened.

She’s the perfect candidate for a Trump pardon, and that’s exactly what she got. Davis is expected to return to her job in the Clerk’s office where she can now refuse to issue marriage licences to gays and not worry about it becoming a “national scandal.” Davis said, “I told them all along I didn’t care if they went to the county down the street. Just not in my building. Not while my God still relies on me to do the right thing.”

God Bless you, Kim Davis. You’re a real piece of work.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i2.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-davis.jpg?resize=678%2C381', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i2.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-davis.jpg?fit=1200%2C630', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/thesharpandthedead.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg?fit=146%2C212', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i1.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weblurredthefaceonanoldphotolol.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/http://ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-lotf-site-header.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i2.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-davis.jpg?fit=1200%2C630,[],"['About Flagg Eagleton', 'Flagg Eagleton Is The Son Of An American Potato Farmer', 'A Patriot.

Holy moly! A (fake) picture of a shark swimming on a Puerto Rico street! (Reddit)

That’s because it is.

Google “shark,” and up pops a great photo of a shark stalking a kayak from a 2005 issue of Africa Geographic.. Commenters on Reddit, where the photo seems to have originated, quickly noted this and the very real similarities between the two sharks (note the small circular shadow just below the shark’s belly.)

Some sites have since realized their error. Neatorama, for example, has removed its story with the photo called “Thank you, Hurricane Irene: Shark in the street.” We’ve asked Channel 7 in Miami, which broadcast the user-submitted photo, if it plans to inform viewers about its fakeness. We will update this post if we hear back.

This phenomenon is nothing new. After the death of Osama bin Laden, a fake photo of his body circulated on Arab news outlets. When the earthquake hit Japan, photographs of a damaged church started circulating. The church was located in Christchurch, New Zealand.

What’s the lesson here? If you see a picture of a dolphin hanging out in Central Park after Irene moves through the East Coast this weekend, you may want to investigate it further.

The interview took place on a podcast earlier today when the subject of religion came up. The interviewer, who is an atheist, was making fun of religion in general but when he began to disparage Mormons in particular, Sandler stepped in:

“I don’t know, Tom. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you’re just having some fun here but – from my experience – Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across.

Some of my neighbors, growing up, were Mormon and they were ideal neighbors, ya know? Their kids were like really, really nice and well-behaved and all of that. Honestly, I don’t know how you could say anything negative about them?

And every Mormon I’ve ever met since that time has been just like that. I’m not even saying anything about their religion. I’m just saying that they’re obviously doing some right, ok!” Sandler said laughing.

He added later, “If all of my neighbors were Mormon now I would sleep very comfortably at night.”

He’s living up to that expectation. By way of financial support, the newly retired American boxer, Mayweather has offered an overwhelming sum of money to the Hurricane Harvey victims.

The World No. 1 undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather has donated 200 million dollars to help rebuild Houston, after the most populous city in the state of Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States was slammed by Hurricane Harvey on Sunday.

The donation which will be utilized through his foundation was announced today after he travelled to Houston to ascertain the damage caused by the hurricane.

“It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,” the American boxing hero said.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/banner-2.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-icon-1-32x32.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/29906170001_5548086489001_5548080719001-vs1-348x215.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/1024x683-jezelf-overwinnen-ballonberg11-348x215.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/untitled-article-1464824443-body-image-14648311641-348x215.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/4b16ed09-5f31-4387-9c3c-bb89ded7a20811.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827im_/http://what-you-missed.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-icon-1-32x32.png,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170912223827/http://what-you-missed.com/floyd-mayweather-jr-donates-a-whopping-sum-of-money-to-houston-after-hurricane/,Floyd Mayweather Jr. Donates a Whopping Sum of Money to Houston After Hurricane – What You Missed,[],,https://web.archive.org,

170,https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851/http://americannews.com/25127-2/,"The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area.

The ship was eventually identified as an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer belonging to the Navy’s 7th fleet.

It is unclear why this ship was over 20 miles inland and trying to navigate through a major metropolitan area or was not able to see the building and take evasive action.

“I had climbed up on my roof due to dem risin’ flood waters, when I saw a big ship sailin’ down the street. I says to myself ‘Oh Lawdy, someone’s done come to rescue us!’ and then it sails right past my house and smack straight into that yonder building,” said Georgia Brown, a resident who witnessed the incident.

Following incidents involving the USS Fitzgerald, USS John S. McCain, and the USS Ted Kennedy, this marks the fifth collision incident this summer for destroyers from the Navy’s besieged 7th fleet.

Even though the Navy declined to comment on the cause of the collision due to an ongoing investigation, it did say that the captain had been relieved of his command.

A senior defense official theorized that the ship had likely veered off course from its patrol route in the South China Sea, despite reserve from the Navy.

Navy officials have stated that they are planning a number of PowerPoint trainings related to urban maritime navigation.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/state-trooper-car-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/navy-destroyer-hit-buidling.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/feds-news-about-hillary-clinton-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/louisiana-governor-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/osberverd-93-yo-woman-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/state-trooper-car-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/donald-turmp-land-texas-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/feds-news-about-hillary-clinton-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mark-hamill-donald-trump-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/donald-turmp-land-texas-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amnewslogo.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/osberverd-93-yo-woman-100x100.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/navy-destroyer-hit-buidling.jpg,[],[],//web.archive.org/web/20170901172851/http://americannews.com/25127-2/,Unbelievable: Navy Destroyer Strikes A Building In Downtown Houston,[],1504235661.0,https://web.archive.org,

In the entire history of the United States, we have never seen anything like this happen before. In fact, prior to this pandemic we had a chronic problem with unemployment that stretched back for decades. Economists insisted that our economy would never be able to produce enough jobs for everyone, but they were wrong. Today, there are more than 10 million open positions in this country and employers are literally begging for people to come to work. Fierce competition for good workers has become extremely intense, and this is one of the factors that is causing millions of Americans to quit their current jobs each month. On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the numbers for the month of November… (Read More...)","['http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/People-Leaving-The-System-Pixabay-560x339.png', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Get-Prepared-Now-Ad1.png', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emmanuel-Macron-Wikimedia-Commons.jpg', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snip20220109_35.png', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Book-Cover-Ad-PNG.png', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Living-A-Life-That-Really-Matters-By-Michael-Snyder.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Get-Prepared-Now-By-Michael-Snyder.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/panama-relocation-banner.gif', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dollar-Death-Spiral-Pixabay-560x360.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Paypal-Donate-Button-300x140.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/320x160.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Final-Book-Cover-For-Websites-1-1-560x554.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mystery-Deaths-Pixabay-560x373.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/End-Time-Headlines-1-300x300.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ec-blog-usa-prophecy.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bare-Shelves-At-A-Walmart-In-Texas-Posted-On-Twitter-By-Jeff-Duncan-560x420.jpeg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Rapture-Verdict-By-Michael-Snyder.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Making-Sense-Of-Revelation.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JWLABS-Square-Banner-Ad-2020_actual.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Military-Guide-to-Armageddon-from-Baker-Publishing-Group-194x300.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ProphecyHour.png', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emmanuel-Macron-Wikimedia-Commons-560x350.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snip20220109_35-560x291.png', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dollar-Death-Spiral-Pixabay.jpg', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mystery-Deaths-Pixabay.jpg', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/People-Leaving-The-System-Pixabay.png', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snip20220104_82.png', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Megadrought.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/A-Target-In-Southern-California-Posted-On-Twitter-By-CAgrl07-560x420.jpeg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Preppers-Blueprint-Economic-Collapse-Blog.png', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/A-Target-In-Southern-California-Posted-On-Twitter-By-CAgrl07.jpeg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snip20220104_82-560x348.png', 'https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bare-Shelves-At-A-Walmart-In-Texas-Posted-On-Twitter-By-Jeff-Duncan.jpeg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Berkey-Filters.jpg', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WPC125x104.jpg']",http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snip20220104_82-560x348.png,[],['Michael Snyder'],https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/,The Economic Collapse,[],1642013102.0,http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com,

174,https://web.archive.org/web/20170911073804/http://yournewswire.com:80/irma-destroy-new-york-city,"All 5 Boroughs of New York City and most of New Jersey could be totally destroyed on September 10 by Hurricane IRMA, according to computer simulations.

By 12:00 noon on September 10, computer models show that the strength and path of IRMA risk totally obliterating New York.

Halturnerradioshow.com reports: The National Weather Service, and its National Hurricane Center utilize supercomputers to predict where hurricanes will travel based on hundreds-of-thousands of pieces of weather data. The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS).

At 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA’s path over the next 12 days. This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast, and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane, with winds in excess of 157 MPH.

I am not a weather expert. I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models. As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong. Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong.

But if this model is right, then we in New Jersey (where I live) and folks in New York City, had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days.

I do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds “in excess of 157 MPH.”

I doubt my condo complex could withstand it. I cannot even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load. I suspect some of them — MANY of them — might just snap and fall over.

Even buildings which don’t simply blow over, would probably see ALL their windows blown out.

Can you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind? It would cut a person to ribbons instantly!

In all of recorded history, no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City. It would be beyond “catastrophic.” Seems to me, there would be NOTHING left!

I emphasize that I know computer “models” are just that: MODELS. They may be very wrong.

But given the specificity of this particular forecast, I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day. If it appears as you see in the model video below, then EVACUATE at least 100 miles west of NJ.

No one would be able to survive this type of storm.

175,https://web.archive.org/web/20160904143028/http://yournewswire.com:80/tens-of-thousands-of-scientists-declare-climate-change-a-hoax/,"A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money.

One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore.

Natural News reports:

In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:

“Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.”

Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.

Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.

Debunking the “97 percent” lie

On top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.

More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.

From the National Review:

“A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.”

Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.

And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.

Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.

Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax

But the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.

176,http://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist/,"MAYADIN, SYRIA—Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, “The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.”

The powerful statement which single-handedly dismantled ISIS came shortly after a terrorist attack on civilians in Manchester killed 22 people, and led the reclusive head of ISIS to hold an emergency press conference declaring the group’s jihad finished.

“Despite my previous belief that we must slay the infidel in the name of Allah until Islam rules the world, I just can’t deny that Katy’s words have touched my heart,” al-Baghdadi said as he symbolically held up and then tossed an AK-47 onto the ground. “It is time for the mujahideen to start uniting and loving on people.”

“I just can’t believe we didn’t see it before. It’s all so clear now,” he added.

After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.

According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.","['https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-7152-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1283-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-9827-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1162-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-329-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1581-thumb.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=326751097945685&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-4494-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10216-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10246-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10230-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-5062-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-990-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10223-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-8412-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-995-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1838-thumb.jpg', 'http://babylonbee.com/img/logo-dark.png']",https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg,[],[],https://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist,"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'",[],,http://babylonbee.com,

Mar-A-Lago was at the front and center of a rogue wave created by the outer bands of Hurricane Irma. The wave, spanning hundreds of yards across and nearly 20-feet high crashed directly into the Palm Beach estate of President Trump.

Several other properties on either side, including the home of guitar legend Kieth Richards, were also destroyed. The staff at Mar-A-Lago had been sent home except for those who live on the property. They were all in the “safe” building towards the rear of the property when the wave hit.

The building, designed by Eric Trump, was supposed to be able to withstand bunker-busting bombs. He told the National Report that the reason the water was able to penetrate was simple physics:

“I designed the building for an air raid. Who would ever think that the threat would come from the side? Those walls were just normal walls to keep cost down. The roof was what was designed to absorb the impact. Mass equals force times accelarated ions.”

Eric Trump was a decorated mathematician at Oxford and scored well above genius on the Hershman-Rorytar Test. Clearly, the fault for Kushner’s probable fate lies with Kushner himself for not seeking proper shelter.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/https://i0.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kushner-is-missing-his-brain.jpg?resize=678%2C381', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/https://i0.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/141.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wheaties-satire.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/https://i1.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/144.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=125&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kushner-is-missing-his-brain.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170914182404im_/http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kushner-is-missing-his-brain.jpg,[],"['About Flagg Eagleton', 'Flagg Eagleton Is The Son Of An American Potato Farmer', 'A Patriot.

“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”

The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community. According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.

“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”

Residents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.

181,http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/The-pro-Russia-pro-weed-pro-Assange-GOP-12195944.php,"COSTA MESA, Orange County — It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.

Then again, Ronald Reagan’s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He’s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that “Putin pays” him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were “a total hoax.”

He’s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that “probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.” During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called “Individual Man.”

If you’re a Democrat, you’re thinking, “How is this guy still holding office in California?”

Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They’re focused on districts like Rohrabacher’s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.

It won’t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin’-the-Gipper part of the OC. He’s run for Congress 15 times, and he’s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he’s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.

That’s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he’s “not worried about Dana at all.” And it doesn’t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.

Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, “this race will be the toughest.” Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, “of Russia.”

Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the “high confidence” with which the nation’s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?

“Total bull—,” Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches — his favorite meal — that he slapped together in his kitchen. “I’ve read those reports and they’re full of weasel words.”

“That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,” he said.

One of Rohrabacher’s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.

Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn’t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn’t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa’s neighborhood.

Rohrabacher isn’t buying that conspiracy theory, but he’s deep into another — that Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.

“It’s all baloney,” Rohrabacher said.

Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former “Hillary and Bernie supporter” got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.

“It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,” Rohrabacher said. “It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation” and to “put our president on the spot.”

Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of “Info Wars,” will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is “Pants on Fire” groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.

Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.

Plus, there’s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher’s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman — and not in a good way.

“People saw ‘incumbent’ and an ‘R’ by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,” said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. “Dana Rohrabacher doesn’t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me ‘We didn’t realize he was this unhinged.’”

Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.

But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.

And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he’s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He’s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign — so far he’s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.

According to the police, Hart lost control of his car and went off the east side of the road and his car crashed head-on into a guardrail while he was driving at a high speed.

Metro Police said 38-year-old US comedian and film star Kevin Hart, was driving faster than the 25 mph speed limit while going north on Spring Gate Lane about 8:20 a.m today.

The undisputed king of comedy, as at the time of filing this report, remained in critical condition at MountainView Hospital in Summerlin, police can confirm.

Drugs and alcohol were not factors in the crash, police said.

A day before this tragic incident, comedian Kevin Hart posted a candid social media message confessing that he made a “bad error in judgement” which recently led to an undisclosed individual making an extortion attempt against him.

In an Instagram video, Hart said that, though he had never claimed to be perfect, he had recently put himself “in an environment where only bad things would happen”.

“I’m not perfect, I’m not gonna sit up here and claim that I am in any shape or form, and I made a bad error in judgement,” he told his followers. “In doing that, I know I’m going to hurt the people closest to me, who I’ve talked to and apologised to, them being my wife and my kids, and you know; it’s a shitty moment.”

Hart then explained that he had chosen to “‘fess up” rather than have someone attempt to make “financial gain from [his] mistakes. In this particular situation, that’s was what was attempted.”","['https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hmt.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i0.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/image3.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/http://nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NYDA.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/was.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bah.png?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i0.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/image3.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/44.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/word.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/omi.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/combo.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i0.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/car-kabob-2.jpg?resize=900%2C600', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/JA.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/omi.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/word.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hmt.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/http://nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/car-kabob-2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/44.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bah.png?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/JA.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/combo.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/heckle.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i2.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/was.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i1.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/heckle.jpg?resize=300%2C180']",https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938im_/https://i0.wp.com/nydailynews-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/car-kabob-2.jpg?resize=900%2C600,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20170923032938/http://nydailynews-tv.com/breaking-us-comedian-kevin-hart-in-critical-condition-after-gory-car-crash/,BREAKING: US comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after gory car crash,[],1451673171.0,https://web.archive.org,
183,www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/susan-rice-house-investigators-unmasked-trump-officials/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former national security adviser Susan Rice privately told House investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year, multiple sources told CNN.

The New York meeting preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House.

The crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, arrived in New York last December in the transition period before Trump was sworn into office for a meeting with several top Trump officials, including Michael Flynn, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his top strategist Steve Bannon, sources said.

The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates, which had failed to mention that Zayed was coming to the United States even though it's customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the US government about their travels, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Rice, who served as then-President Obama's national security adviser in his second term, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common.

Rice's previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman, California Rep. Devin Nunes, and President Donald Trump, who previously accused Rice of committing a crime

But her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump and raising new questions about whether any Trump associates tried to arrange back-channel discussions with the Russians.

""I didn't hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal,"" Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican helping to lead the panel's Russia invesigation, told CNN of Rice's testimony. He declined to discuss any of the contents of her classified remarks.

Through a spokeswoman, Rice declined to comment about her testimony. Nunes refused to answer questions when asked about Rice Tuesday evening.

It's unclear precisely which Trump officials Rice discussed at the House meeting. But multiple sources have confirmed to CNN that Zayed met at the time with Flynn, Kushner and Bannon. The three-hour discussion focused on a range of issues, including Iran, Yemen and the Mideast peace process, according to two sources who insisted that opening up a back-channel with Russia was not a topic of discussion.

Still, the fact that the New York meeting occurred prior to the Seychelles session and that the UAE did not notify the Obama administration about why the crown prince was coming to the United States has raised questions in the eyes of investigators on Capitol Hill.

A secret meeting in the Seychelles

But the Trump Tower meeting came shortly before the UAE brokered a meeting to open lines of communications with the United States and Russia, with a clandestine January meeting in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, according to reports in CNN and The Washington Post. That meeting is now under investigation on Capitol Hill, though it's unclear whether Rice mentioned the Seychelles meeting in the testimony.

A senior Middle East official told CNN that the UAE did not ""mislead"" the Obama administration about the crown prince's visit, but acknowledged not telling the US government about it in advance. The meeting, which took place December 15, 2016, the official said, was simply an effort to build a relationship with senior members of the Trump team who would be working in the administration to share assessments of the region.

""The meeting was about ascertaining the Trump team's view of the region and sharing the UAE's view of the region and what the US role should be,"" the official said. ""No one was coming in to sell anything or arrange anything.""

A spokesperson for the crown prince declined to comment.

The Seychelles meeting -- and the circumstances around it -- has been a subject of interest to Hill investigators looking at any potential link between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The Washington Post initially reported in April that the UAE brokered a pre-inauguration meeting between the founder of the security firm Blackwater, Erik Prince, who is a close Trump ally, and an associate of Vladimir Putin's in the Seychelles Islands. The purpose of the meeting was part of an effort by the UAE to persuade Russia to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, according to the Post.

And it occured shortly after Bannon, Flynn and Kushner also met in Trump Tower with Zayed, whom the Post said helped arrange the Seychelles meeting with Russia government officials to set up the private discussions with the Trump team.

But the senior Middle East official told CNN this week that Prince's name was not discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. And Prince himself has said he did nothing wrong, telling CNN's Erin Burnett last month: ""I was there for business.""

Both the White House and Prince have strongly denied that Prince was working as a liaison for the Trump administration.

Prince said he met with a Russian while at the Seychelles but ""I don't remember his name.""

""It probably lasted about, as long as one beer,"" he said about the meeting.

Explaining 'unmasking'

For her part, Rice had been called to the House Intelligence Committee to testify partly over what Nunes and other Republicans believed was an abuse in the practice of ""unmasking"" -- or revealing the identities of Americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the US intelligence community. Simply unmasking the names of individuals in classified reports does not mean that their identities will be revealed publicly, and Rice denied to the committee that she leaked classified information to the press, sources familiar with the matter said.

But Rice's suggestion that she unmasked the names of US individuals -- who turned out to be Trump associates -- over concerns about the propriety of the crown prince's visit to the United States could help her fend off attacks that she was out of line in the actions she took.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who is helping lead the House investigation, told the Daily Caller ""nothing that came up in her interview that led me to conclude"" that she improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates or leaked it to the press.

Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say explicitly whether Trump still believes Rice committed a crime but added the issue of leaking and unmasking needs to be investigated.

""We've seen illegal leaking of classified materials, including the identities of American citizens unmasked in intelligence reports,"" Sanders told CNN. ""That's why the President called for Congress to investigate this matter and why the Department of Justice and Intelligence Community are doing all they can to stamp out this dangerous trend that undermines our national security.""

Nunes was forced to step aside from running the Russia investigation amid a House ethics inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified data. The ethics inquiry came in the aftermath of his bombshell comments that Obama administration officials had improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates, a revelation that Trump used as cover for his unsubstantiated claim that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him. The Justice Department said in a court filing Friday that the DOJ and the FBI have no evidence to support Trump's claims.

But on Tuesday, the Republican who took over the investigation from Nunes said there was no reason to bring Rice in for further questioning.

""She was a good witness, answered all our questions,"" Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican now running the House Russia probe, told CNN. ""I'm not aware of any reason to bring her back.""","['https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405102606-01-susan-rice-04-super-tease.jpg', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170522175218-michael-flynn-january-10-2017-large-169.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170613160719-the-russia-investigation-logo-large-169.png', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170707144827-01-putin-trump-g20-meeting-07-07-2017-large-169.jpg', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170522175329-michael-flynn-december-5-2016-large-169.jpg', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404171304-susan-rice-2015-file-exlarge-169.jpg', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170403142900-senate-judiciary-committe-feinstein-grassley-0403-large-169.jpg', 'http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170522174514-michael-flynn-white-house-large-169.jpg']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170405102606-01-susan-rice-04-super-tease.jpg,[],"['Manu Raju', 'Senior Congressional Correspondent']",https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/susan-rice-house-investigators-unmasked-trump-officials/index.html,Rice told investigators why she unmasked Trump aides,[],1505232000.0,http://www.cnn.com,

How Are Laws Made?

Laws begin as ideas. First, a representative sponsors a bill. The bill is then assigned to a committee for study. If released by the committee, the bill is put on a calendar to be voted on, debated or amended. If the bill passes by simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill. Finally, a conference committee made of House and Senate members works out any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The resulting bill returns to the House and Senate for final approval. The Government Printing Office prints the revised bill in a process called enrolling. The President has 10 days to sign or veto the enrolled bill.","['https://www.house.gov/sites/default/themes/housegov/favicon.ico', 'https://www.house.gov/sites/default/files/styles/featured_image/public/uploads/images-page-featured/learn-rotunda_1.jpg?itok=BYKwo-y9', 'https://www.house.gov/sites/default/themes/housegov/logo.svg']",https://www.house.gov/sites/default/themes/housegov/favicon.ico,[],[],https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/the-legislative-process,The Legislative Process,[],,https://www.house.gov,

BREAKING: NFL Fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1m Each For Skipping National Anthem – YouTube

The hooey hit the fanbase. That is, when the NFL Black Lives Don’t Matter gang attacked patriotism and the US flag and most of the football fans, this blew up big time to the point, the frightened commissioner of this gang of thugs suddenly woke up and issued his first punishment for the people protesting at games: a million dollars each! I hope for two things: Villanueva is exempt plus since he was intimidated by both coach, the owner of the Steelers and fellow teammates, 50% of this fine should go to him! How about that?



Alejandro Villanueva apologizes for throwing Steeler teammates ‘under the bus’ – YouTube

Kim of North Korea is now running the NFL, it appears. The abject apology of this poor football player is backfiring very badly. People are twice as angry as before. Now, the hatred of the ‘other players’ who dissed the American flag is not gone away, either. They demanded everyone join them in being anti-patriotic and now this poor guy is doing exactly that. The NFL is now in dire straits. Like the DNC, they think they can impose their ideology on everyone else via force. Well, it isn’t working at all.

As I said above, Villanueva is the only member of that ‘team’ that stood up for America and he was then muscled by thugs threatening his life and livelihood and who forced him to do a miserable retraction of his good, patriotic deed. People are very angry at him for surrendering but then, he had everyone against him. Now, he should be rehabilitated, he needs a HUGE apology from the entire NFL leadership and his former teammates.

Fire chief apologizes for calling Steelers’ coach Mike Tomlin ‘n-word’ on Facebook | TribLIVE

Chief Paul Smith, who leads Cecil’s Volunteer Fire Department No. 2 in Muse, Washington County, posted the comment in response to the Steelers’ decision not to not take the field for the national anthem. “Tomlin just added himself to the list of no good n-words. Yes I said it,” Smith wrote in the post.Cecil’s board of supervisors said the comment was troublesome. “The Cecil Township Board of Supervisors is deeply disturbed by the comments made by volunteer Chief Smith, and in no way, shape or form condone his comments,” officials said in a written statement.

See? This man said something rash. He is immediately punished. The NFL players who decided to toss the US flag in the trash and attack the President for talking about their disrespect of the US voters and citizens…they should also be punished heavily, no? Of course! Liberals think PC punishment is a one way street.

They can cuss, swear, be abusive, harass and even physically attack fellow citizens and nothing is done to stop this! But anyone else says the wrong words and they lose their jobs and are punished in many ways. This is causing tremendous ire and is the #1 reason many voted for Trump.

Not One More Dime: NFL Stadiums Have Collected Over $1.1 Billion in Federal Subsidies – Time to Cut Them Off. Calls to stop the NFL gravy train is rising. Even if Goodell manages to muscle the teams into behaving themselves, it is not going to work for the fan base can see that the people playing the game really hate them and so this comrade business is kaput.

According to FOX Sports over the last 20 years, the American public has spent more than $7 billion dollars to build or renovate NFL stadiums, taking on 46 percent of the total costs of those projects. It’s time to cut them off. They don’t respect the country. Why should the country respect them?

The coach of the Steelers sponsored Hillary’s run for President. Note the loot she asked for, show up to see her, you had to pay $330000+. What a rip-off!

Pushing this pile of toothpaste back into the tube is impossible now. petition: CUT OFF ALL FEDERAL TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO NFL, PAYING BILLIONS TO LEAGUE. NO MORE . is one example.

NFL gives up tax exempt status – Apr. 28, 2015 which was about time. But they still suck off the public teat via moving teams around while making demands for freebies like free stadiums, etc. NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers – Jan. 30, 2015 despite being ‘taxed’ lightly.

Stadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns. Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds. Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday’s Super Bowl — to the tune of about $300 million.

All this will go crashing down unless the team owners wake up and figure out who their audience really is.

The National Hurricane Center has issued twelve more hurricane warnings for the east coast of the US. Hurricanes Ophelia, Hurricane Philippe, Hurricane Selma, Hurricane Tammy, Hurricane Vince, are expected to hit in the next two weeks, with seven additional hurricanes to follow next month. ""Regardless of which coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate at least twelve times"" the National Weather Services said Thursday, not ruling out the possibility of a thirteenth hurricane by the end of the year.

Wednesday 12 January 2059 10821 Shares

The legislature of Washington State has met in special session and overwhelming voted to change the name of the State. Since George Washington owned Slaves, it is improper for this State to be named after him. Due to the great support provided to the cause of eliminating the history of slavery in the United States by George Soros, the Legislature of Washington has chosen the new name of Soros State. The change in name will take effect on November 1st, 2017 once the Governor of Washington signs the bill

The New Orleans Saints made the mistake of once again disrespecting our veterans, our country, and our flag. After an embarrassing opening to a game with the worst ratings in Saints’ history, the players and coaches learned that their actions have consequences.

Both the pilot and co-pilot of the Boeing 737 the Saints use to travel are combat-hardened American heroes. They flew sorties over Baghdad with Saddam’s best weapons firing back. They fought with their lives for your freedom and watched many of their friends die. Today they took a stand for those brave souls:

“We couldn’t be a party to the disrespect. We waited until we were cleared and last off the runway for the night , walked out of the cockpit, took a knee and deplaned. They’re not going anywhere until tomorrow.”

Looks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they’re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they’re told to do in the league rulebook.

This week was the worst week in NFL history for ratings. Next week will be worse.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a197f8bc01e406b3db29bf11be7b5202?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8378d0c4e6affd7d72ffd249e932ef42?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a19276ec87052ecd5cb2f2ec86f2afd1?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/222b042959bd05d5c31e4ef2ae498413?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b6feff9883e378eb4fc1ccacc70ed4bc?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9c23b64f2a5e6b04a056714a5388106a?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Untitled-design-24-480x315.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3eb4b6bf27d337d5a70b7d4fb184b146?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bbe171286413665b0a11a79afffe8140?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/30d2a368c5a20d9720d3a48a8a51ffb1?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/buttle-480x384.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2870a6a495a46f890d41487702e3dd11?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iwouldtotallybonethisman-480x384.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/88ed2bc1e964e79a86959afc88d5a745?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/99aa1d854a2736de219d9fd922ec512a?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/85630713a01533510943d1ebc9231b48?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rs-jr-smith-42ee1905-1d4b-4c20-8faa-2b5590f0232f-480x384.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/165.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b69325bd4b196a837435afbf5253464d?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LOGO.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2526b28430610fb9f4d2c428758b7cf3?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/891ff9d4627615a213b7a28ae6504ebf?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c93433e116a14155480e3ef198e4b07?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/adbcd3c9406b2df8d322715ca196b96a?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ea3362db310e73e0d08bd088fb92348d?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a49cb2e7c5aff8ce62d46d3d76996d35?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bc06c76a8eef3d358c6260c02a560286?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c16c1c984b4515cc7cdddfdb4cd0ae3f?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6edfffdad07c4cae41128b24a84fd359?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3db236b06c0182f045826f06ae53f131?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/924e680e40418fc7d2c692fcb3113c53?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d2a2879032ebe5f5d8e99ab796390245?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/notthebutler-678x381-480x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/764f8acb4f94c134c02feac8580c0145?s=60&d=mm&r=g']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/165.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225/http://dailyfeed.news/flight-crew-takes-a-knee-and-walks-off-leaving-new-orleans-saints-stranded-on-runway/,"Flight Crew Takes A Knee And Walks Off, Leaving New Orleans Saints Stranded On Runway",[],1506953622.0,https://web.archive.org,

The reality TV family banded together to raise $1 million to the families of victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.

Earlier today, we announced that the Kardashian family will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims.

Also, to benefit those impacted by the shooting, the Kardashian family will be hosting a “Day of Giving” on October 7. A “Day of Giving” will begin on Friday morning with other American celebrities and continue throughout the day on E!News. Across our social platforms, there will be a #DayofGiving call-to-action to donate to the victims of Las vegas shooting, with those dollars going to benefit those most impacted, the statement read.

“Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting,” said Kim Kardashian. The most decorated family said it’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.”-the family continued.

“Las Vegas we are praying for you,” Khloé Kardashian tweeted immediately after announcing the family’s donation.

More than 50 people were killed and more than 500 more injured in a terrifying massacre Sunday night. It’s being reported by outlets as the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States.

A gunman, now identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire on a country-music festival from a hotel window inside the nearby Mandalay Bay. Paddock shot and killed himself; Las Vegas Metro Police officers found him dead in the room.

Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Las Vegas and again it’s our most fervent prayer we get enough security to make life fright-free again in the Nevada city.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kard.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GTU.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/AMT.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BB.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sav.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jk-1.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sd.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kard.jpg?resize=728%2C567', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BB.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sav.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sd.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GTU.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KOB.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Houson.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ads.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wr.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/45.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KOB.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jk-1.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/45.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ads.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wr.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/AMT.jpg?resize=80%2C80']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kard.jpg?resize=728%2C567,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171228144534/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/the-kardashians-donate-whopping-sum-to-las-vegas-mass-shooting-victims/,The Kardashians donate whopping sum to Las Vegas mass shooting victims,[],1451665816.0,https://web.archive.org,

Sonny Melton, 29, was fatally gunned down protecting wife Heather from the hail of bullets shooter Stephen Paddock rained down on the Route 91 music festival, his wife said.

“He saved my life,” Heather Gulish Melton told USA Today. “He grabbed me from behind and started running when I felt him get shot in the back.

“At this point, I’m in complete disbelief and despair. I don’t know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met,” she added in a statement to radio station WCYB.

The couple both worked at the Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn. — he was a registered nurse and she is an orthopedic surgeon, the hospital said in a statement.

Melton “checked in” at the event on his Facebook page Friday night — and condolences flooded the post’s comments thread Monday.

Days before, his wife had posted a photo of the smiling couple wearing matching Eric Church shirts — Route 91’s headline act.","['https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack-9.8/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif', 'http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0', 'https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/rhosls-index.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1', 'https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/4137224153001/5b140233-f2f6-4ac9-81a7-f9f8200acd0f/e0aa669b-9205-4e60-9e57-ee0bcb68d991/1280x720/match/image.jpg', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/underwear-feature.png?w=260', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/norah-o-donnell.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/vegas_shooting_victims.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/shutterstock_1222121032.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/vegas_shooting_victims.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=740', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png', 'https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brazen.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1']",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/vegas_shooting_victims.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024,[],['Social Links For Ruth Brown'],https://nypost.com/2017/10/02/wife-of-las-vegas-massacre-victim-he-saved-my-life-and-lost-his/,Wife of Las Vegas massacre victim: ‘He saved my life and lost his’,[],1506873600.0,http://nypost.com,

197,https://observeronline.news/president-trump-signs-executive-order-stripping-nfl-of-non-profit-status/,"The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.

The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.

To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”

The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”

The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”

When Donald Trump hinted that he may end aid to Puerto Rico over the mayor of San Juan’s decision to withhold aid from the rest of the country, the city’s other leaders finally took action.

While Puerto Rico’s Governor has praised Donald Trump’s efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come into San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.

“We simply don’t have the staff or resources to distribute countrywide,” Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that “anyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.”

Unfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.

Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/noooos-480x384.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nastywoman-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/spec-480x384.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3bd18071be8145f7830c9c957db88ff5?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4efeb444e3b493521b42cfb31b12d206?s=60&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sarah-Huckabee-Sanders-696x374-480x374.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/michelle-obamas-secret-480x317.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/trump-2-480x274.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LOGO.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nastywoman-678x381.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621/http://dailyfeed.news/san-juan-city-council-votes-unanimously-to-impeach-trump-hating-mayor/,San Juan City Council Votes Unanimously To Impeach Trump-Hating Mayor,[],1507850141.0,https://web.archive.org,

.

While filming a segment for The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, Hillary Rodham Clinton was nabbed on tape saying the most awful thing imaginable about Hurricane Irma and its potential victims:

.

TO BE HONEST, RACHEL, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY IF IRMA WERE TO JUST WIPE EVERY FLORIDA HILLBILLY OFF THE MAP. I MEAN…THEY LIVE IN TRAILERS BY THE WATER, RIGHT?”

.

Clinton began to laugh but Maddow stopped her:

.

“MADAM SECRETARY, THAT’S NOT FUNNY. THERE ARE 37 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE PATH OF THE WORST STORM OUR COUNTRY HAS SEEN SINCE KATRINA AND IT WILL PROBABLY DO MORE DAMAGE. THAT WAS CALLOUS AND WRONG. YOU’VE BEEN POISONED. NOT EVERYTHING IS POLITICS.”

.

Maddow cancelled the interview and agreed to bury the footage, but one sound engineer who is a true patriot managed to keep a copy:

.

“AS SOON AS I HEARD HER SAY IT I KNEW SHE SCREWED UP REAL BAD. SHE WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE BACKSTAGE ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN IN 2020. THERE AIN’T NO WAY SHE’S GONNA RUN NOW. NOT WITHOUT MAKING ME A VERY RICH MAN.”

.

The engineer, who refused to be named, says he will hold onto the footage until he needs it to either “save the country or himself.” He says he’s made “arrangements” in case anything happens to him.

201,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/17/ice-detainer-issued-for-suspected-wine-country-arsonist-in-sonoma-jail/,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.

Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.

Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.

Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.

Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.

The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”

According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.

Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","['https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/12/2nd-lt-Brittany-Ramos-DeBarros-filephoto-us-army-200x150.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/08/Anthony-Fauci-eyes-raised-pointing-up-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/03/GettyImages-1231892472-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/10/Kamala-1-200x150.jpeg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/hillary-queens-university-inauguration-AP-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/More-Wine-Country-fires-Getty-640x480.jpg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Kevin-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/AP_20065647577600-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/01/India-vaccine-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Joe-Biden-Rants-in-Georgia-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1237644898-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Hans-von-Spakovsky-file-Nov2018-osce-flickr-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/coronavirus-body-bag-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1356217545-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/More-Wine-Country-fires-Getty.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/AP20142278929585-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Mystal88-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Sarah-Stier_Getty-Images-7-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Shi-Zhengli-wuhan-lab-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/earns-saudi-aramco-june-28-2021-file-photo-saudi-aramco-engineers-journalists-at-hawiyah-natural-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/empty-shelves-warren-inset-getty-200x150.jpg']",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/More-Wine-Country-fires-Getty.jpg,[],['Chriss W.

205,https://web.archive.org/web/20171021234144/http://yournewswire.com/youngest-leader-george-soros/,"The world’s youngest leader, newly-elected Sebastian Kurz, has informed George Soros that his Open Society Foundation has 28 days to cease and desist operations in Austria or face legal action for “attempting to undermine the democracy of the nation.”

31-year-old Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s youngest ever leader, has told colleagues that action must be taken immediately, after news broke that George Soros has donated $18 billion of his $24 billion dollar fortune to his Open Society Foundation.

“The situation has become critical,” Kurz said. “Soros is throwing everything he has behind his push for global control. Misinformation and media manipulation has already increased exponentially overnight. We have no room for complacency.“

Kurz, a self-described truther who says he was “red pilled” by the 9/11 film Loose Change, claims that he understands the Soros agenda, and “there is no way in hell this country will be his fifth victim.”

It is understood the Austrian chancellor is referring to the number of national economies Soros has crashed in order to gain enormous personal profit and political influence.

Asked why he was banning George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, Kurz said, “Because it’s 2017.“

The news that Soros has released 75% of his vast fortune to push his political and social agenda has caused shockwaves around the world, with many democratically elected leaders expressing fear that the sheer weight of his billions, used to buy politicians and journalists, will be difficult to fight against.

Kurz agrees. This is why he has taken fast action.

“The specter of Soros is the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017. He is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money, using this money to corrupt politicians, journalists and the public sector, and attempting to create the world in his image.

“The people of Austria have rejected the New World Order, and it is my duty and my privilege to uphold their will.”","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171021234144im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fukushima-humpback-whale-80x60.jpg',

206,www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/2/17164266/trump-russia-mueller-email-hackings-dnc-clinton,"Update: On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials who he alleges are involved in these hackings and leaks. You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below.

Original post: There’s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn’t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails.

The hacking and release of leading political figures’ emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia’s government. And it’s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what “collusion” between Donald Trump’s team and the Russians might have involved.

That’s not mere speculation. We’ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don’t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance — but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller’s team.

These hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them). The operation was more wide-ranging than many remember, targeting not just John Podesta and the DNC but many other people and groups. It wasn’t just emails stolen, either — posted material ranged from Democratic Party turnout data that a Republican operative thought was “probably worth millions of dollars” to even a purported picture of Michelle Obama’s passport.

No charges have been filed in the matter — yet. But some are likely coming. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the US has identified “more than six members of the Russian government” involved in the DNC hacks. And the Daily Beast wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind “Guccifer 2.0,” a leading figure in the hacks. Mueller is now overseeing the probe.

To understand what happened in 2016, we have to understand the hackings. And though some mysteries remain, much of the complex story has gradually been pieced together by journalists and cybersecurity experts. The consequences, of course, unfolded in plain sight during the campaign itself.

How the hacks happened (a phishing expedition)

The media often shorthands the 2016 hack story as: Russians hacked Podesta and the DNC’s email accounts, and WikiLeaks then posted those hacked emails publicly.

The full story is more complex. Let’s start at the beginning.

Between March 2015 and May 2016, a group of hackers went on a phishing expedition. The “baited lines” they cast out were at least 19,000 malicious emails that resembled the one below:

These emails were designed to look as if they were coming from Google. But they were in fact designed to trick people into clicking through and entering their login credentials — delivering them right into the hackers’ hands.

According to a later Associated Press analysis of a report by the information security firm SecureWorks, at least 573 of the more than 4,700 email addresses targeted were American. They included many US government officials, military officials, intelligence officials, and defense contractors.

Particularly beginning in March and April 2016, these targets began to include many Democrats as well. Per the AP, more than 130 Democratic accounts were sent these malicious links, compared to just “a handful” of Republican accounts. Podesta and several Clinton staffers — along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, and others — had their accounts successfully compromised. (We know all this because the hackers used the link-shortening tool Bitly to do their work and accidentally left their activity publicly viewable.)

Russia was eventually blamed for the phishing expedition, for several reasons. For one, SecureWorks concluded the particular malware used in this campaign was tied to a hacking group that outside researchers had been tracking for some time — a group they thought to be linked the GRU, Russia’s foreign military intelligence agency. We don’t know what the secretive hacking group calls itself, but various cybersecurity researchers had given it several names: Iron Twilight, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) 28, Pawn Storm, and — most famously — “Fancy Bear.”

Circumstantial evidence also suggests a Russian-tied culprit. For instance, the phishers were extremely focused on Ukraine — at least 545 targeted email accounts were from there, comparable to the number of American targets. These included Ukraine’s president and many other top government officials, who are hostile to Vladimir Putin’s regime.

The Russians targeted, meanwhile, were generally critics of Putin’s government and journalists. Another interesting detail, per the AP, is that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were created between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday — Moscow time.

Around April 2016, as this phishing campaign increasingly began to target Democrats, material was also taken from the DNC. The firm Crowdstrike attributed this as a hack from Fancy Bear, citing the malware used, and other firms agreed with this assessment. These firms also concluded that a separate group of Russian-tied hackers (dubbed “Cozy Bear”) had been in the DNC’s systems for much longer, since all the way back in the summer of 2015.

The precise mechanisms of how the DNC was breached remain somewhat murky. But Fancy Bear’s phishing campaign did send out malicious links to nine DNC email accounts in March and April 2016. And as we’ll soon see, hacked DNC material ended up in the same place as hacked material from Podesta and others. A January 2017 US intelligence report would later specifically blame Russia’s GRU — the agency thought to be behind Fancy Bear — for taking “large volumes of data from the DNC.”

As striking as all this may seem, though, government-backed hacking is far from unusual. The US does it. Our allies do it. Our rivals do it. China was said to have hacked Barack Obama and John McCain’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and was then tied to a massive theft of federal data in 2015. Foreign intelligence agencies trying to peek into political activities seemed to be something that just, well, happened all the time.

What came next in 2016, however, was a jarring departure from these norms — the hacked information began to be posted publicly, in massive amounts.

A timeline of odd events between the hacks and the leaks

The backdrop to all of this was the US presidential election — the first series of primaries and caucuses took place in February and early March. The surprisingly Russia-friendly Donald Trump emerged as the clear leader in the Republican contest, over his Putin-critical rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, with whom Putin’s regime had long had chilly relations, emerged as the favorite for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders.

It was around this point — in mid-March 2016 — that the phishing campaign began to particularly target many Democrats’ and Clinton campaign staffers’ email accounts, according to SecureWorks’ analysis.

There were several other events that, in retrospect, are either relevant or at the very least intriguing:

April 7: Putin condemns the Panama Papers leak . In early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth — the Panama Papers. Many of the documents revealed financial information about Putin’s inner circle, and Putin publicly claimed the stories were part of a US plot against Russia. “They are trying to destabilize us from within in order to make us more compliant,” he said. Many have posited that the Russian government may have then wished to retaliate.

DCLeaks’ posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties. That’s because they included the hacked emails of retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, who had commanded NATO forces in Europe and pushed for a harder line against Russia in Ukraine. They also included documents from George Soros’s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.)

(The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.) June 9: The Trump Tower meeting: Shortly afterward, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met a Russian lawyer and four other people with Russian ties at Trump Tower. Don Jr. had agreed to take the meeting based on the promise of “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary,” as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” (as it was put to him in an email). Everyone involved claims nothing came of this meeting.

Throughout all this time, there was no public indication that the phishing campaign, or the hacking of the DNC and other campaign figures’ emails, had taken place. Just days later, that would change.

The email leaks begin

On June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a bombshell. “We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,” he announced, during a British television interview. “We have emails pending publication.”

WikiLeaks — a nonprofit launched back in 2006 by Assange, an Australian activist — had previously been most famous for posting a plethora of internal US military documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (including video of a deadly airstrike) and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the US State Department — leaked by Chelsea Manning. Assange was then accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, and he sought political asylum from Ecuador. He has been holed up in the nation’s London embassy since June 2012.

Assange’s announcement was the first public indication that Democrats would soon be plagued by leaked internal emails. So two days after that, the DNC, which had learned of the hacking of its systems and hired Crowdstrike to respond, decided to get in front of what it feared was coming. The committee told the Washington Post that it had been hacked — by, it claimed, the Russian government. Crowdstrike’s CEO put up a blog post explaining why he identified Russia as the culprit.

Yet the next day, June 15, things got even weirder — because that is when “Guccifer 2.0” arrived on the scene. (The name, a portmanteau of “Gucci” and “Lucifer,” is an homage to the original Guccifer, the jailed Romanian hacker Marcel Leher Lazar, who’d broken into high-profile Americans’ email accounts.)

In a Wordpress post, the new Guccifer said that Crowdstrike was quite wrong about the DNC hack, which he said was carried out by him, “a lone hacker.” (“Fuck CrowdStrike!!!” he wrote.) He said that he’d given “the main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails” that he’d stolen, to WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks has refused to confirm that he was its source.) He also began to post several documents he claimed were from the DNC server.

Almost immediately, journalists pointed to inconsistencies in Guccifer’s story and linguistic tics to suggest he was Russian — or more than one Russian. (US intelligence agencies would eventually say Russia’s GRU was behind the persona, and the Daily Beast recently reported that the account’s user once slipped up and neglected to mask his identity through a VPN — allowing investigators to match a particular Russian intelligence officer to that Guccifer 2.0 login.)

Yet what Guccifer had access to was clearly broader than just the DNC. None of the first documents he posted showed up in WikiLeaks’ DNC email dump, and in fact, many of them eventually showed up in John Podesta’s emails, which were released much later. Additionally, on June 27, Guccifer emailed the Smoking Gun’s William Bastone a link to a password-protected post on DCLeaks.com that contained phished emails and documents from Clinton staffer Sarah Hamilton. (DCLeaks had not yet publicly posted any material related to the election.)

On July 6, Guccifer 2.0 posted his first documents that would eventually be found in the DNC emails. The New Yorker’s Raffi Khatchadourian speculates, based on some comments Guccifer made to journalists at the time, that Guccifer or his handlers were frustrated that WikiLeaks was taking too long to actually post the DNC material and were threatening to spoil Assange’s exclusive. (A week later, Guccifer would send documents to the Hill’s Joe Uchill, writing that he was doing so because the press was “gradually forget[ing] about me,” and complained that WikiLeaks was “playing for time.”)

All the while, Assange and WikiLeaks were working to prepare their database of DNC emails, with the apparent goal of publishing them before the Democratic convention began in late July. It’s unclear how they set that goal. Assange would later tell Khatchadourian that he originally had a deadline of July 18 to release them, but “we were given a little more time.” (It’s unclear, though, who gave him more time, and Assange later disputed the accuracy of the recorded quote.)

Finally, on July 22 — the Friday before the convention — WikiLeaks posted those thousands of DNC emails and attachments online. They revealed that many DNC members privately spoke of Bernie Sanders with disdain, drove DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top staffers to resign, and overall made an ugly start for the Democratic convention. Though Assange remained mum on his source, Guccifer 2.0 jubilantly claimed credit in a tweet:

The DNC leaks proved to be just the beginning. News soon broke that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had also been hacked, and on August 12, DCCC documents started showing up on Guccifer’s Wordpress site. Guccifer also sent the DCCC’s internal turnout model data to Florida Republican Party operative Aaron Nevins, who was positively thrilled to receive it. “Holy fuck man I don’t think you realize what you gave me,” Nevins wrote in a DM. “This is probably worth millions of dollars.” Nevins soon put it online on his anonymously run blog.

Then DCLeaks got in the game. On August 12, the site posted a few emails from some little-known Republican state party aides, and from campaign advisers to Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were known as Russia hawks. In September, the site’s anonymous administrators sent Colin Powell’s phished emails to reporters, revealing his candid assessments of both Clinton (“greedy”) and Trump (“national disgrace”).

DCLeaks then posted phished emails from Ian Mellul, an Obama White House staffer who had volunteered for Clinton. The Mellul documents included a picture of Michelle Obama’s passport and a months-old audio file in which Hillary Clinton said Sanders’s young supporters were “living in their parents’ basement.” Longtime Clinton ally Capricia Marshall’s phished emails came next.

Many of these disclosures caused brief stirs, but what everyone was really waiting for was the next WikiLeaks dump. Roger Stone, the Trump associate, claimed that he knew Assange had something huge on the way and speculated it would involve the Clinton Foundation.

Assange himself told Fox News back on August 24 that his team had “thousands of pages of material” and was “working around the clock” to prepare it for publication. By early October, there was still nothing from WikiLeaks, but Stone continued to hype an imminent release, saying “an intermediary” who’d met with Assange said “the mother lode is coming Wednesday.”

The “mother lode” instead came two days later, on Friday, October 7, when WikiLeaks posted its first batch of Podesta’s emails. The site would continue to post them, in batches, up through the election. Earlier on that very same day, the US government officially attributed the hacking effort to the Russian government, and the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape hit the news.

In the end, the 2016 election was close, decided by just over 1 percentage point in three Electoral College states. And whether or not the email leaks were sufficient to swing the outcome, they certainly were effective at keeping the words “Hillary Clinton” and “emails” in the headlines throughout the campaign’s final stretch.

Trump associates tried to get in touch with hackers or leakers at least six separate times

During the campaign, it was clear enough that Trump was unusually friendly to Russia, and that the Russian government interventions seemed aimed at trying to help his electoral chances at the expense of Hillary Clinton. But after the election, more and more attention became devoted to whether Trump associates and Putin’s government coordinated to intervene in the campaign in some way. And on March 20, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating just that topic.

No one has produced a smoking gun demonstrating clear involvement just yet. But this isn’t mere idle speculation, either — there are at least six instances in which Trump associates tried to get Russian dirt or communicated with hacking and leaking figures. The first of them was what initiated the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia to begin with:

1) The Papadopoulos tip: Fancy Bear’s phishing campaign targeted Clinton staffers and Democrats in large numbers in March and April 2016, but the hacks remained publicly unknown for months afterward. Yet it was very early indeed — on April 26 — that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got his tip about what was coming.

As described above, the tip was from a source Papadopoulos understood to have Russian government connections, professor Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud specifically said he’d gained his information from traveling to Moscow and meeting high-level officials there. And he said Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton — and, specifically, thousands of emails.

We don’t yet know whether he told others in the Trump campaign about what he’d heard. But it seems highly likely that he did. He was a young adviser eager to impress campaign higher-ups. And we already know he drunkenly bragged about his inside info to an Australian diplomat a few weeks later. (The Australians later told the FBI, which led the bureau to open the investigation.)

In any case, Papadopoulos was arrested last summer for making false statements to FBI investigators, cut a plea deal, and began cooperating with investigators. So whatever he did do with his tip, Mueller likely now knows it.

2) The Trump Tower meeting: It was on June 3, 2016 — a little more than a month after Papadopoulos’s tip, but still before any news broke about Democrats having been hacked — that publicist Rob Goldstone emailed an acquaintance of his, Donald Trump Jr. Goldstone described some news from his clients Aras and Emin Agalarov, a father-son pair of real estate developers who’d done business with the Trumps:

The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.

Don Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer, and Goldstone arranged a meeting six days later, on June 9. The Trump delegation included Don Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner. They met Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov company executive Ike Kaveladze, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator Anatoli Samochornov.

Once the existence of the meeting became public, all parties involved claimed it was a dud, resulting in nothing of consequence. But the timing of the meeting is strange. Three days later, Assange announced he’d received emails related to Hillary Clinton. Two days after that, the DNC announced it had been hacked and blamed Russia.

Goldstone saw an article about that and emailed it to Emin and Kaveladze, writing that the news was “eerily weird” considering what they’d just discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. Guccifer 2.0 began posting the day after that.

3) The Cambridge Analytica CEO’s contacts with WikiLeaks: Cambridge Analytica is the Steve Bannon-tied firm that did digital work for the Trump campaign and has been in the news of late.

And last year, we learned that Cambridge’s CEO, Alexander Nix, had twice contacted WikiLeaks on the topic of hacked emails.

Nix says that in “early June,” after he learned of Assange’s claims to have Hillary Clinton-related emails, he reached out to Julian Assange to ask for an advance look at those emails. He says Assange turned him down.

Then in August, after Assange had posted the DNC emails, Nix emailed Cambridge employees to say that he’d recently reached out to Assange again, offering help at organizing the DNC material on WikiLeaks. He said he hadn’t yet heard back. Both Nix and Assange have said these overtures didn’t go anywhere.

4) Donald Trump Jr.’s contacts with WikiLeaks: Then, separately, Donald Trump Jr. had some communications with WikiLeaks through the group’s Twitter account toward the end of the campaign.

As best we know, WikiLeaks began the communication, DMing Don Jr. to tell him that they had guessed the password to a new “PAC run anti-Trump site,” PutinTrump.org, that was about to launch. “Any comments?” the group asked. Trump Jr. answered: “Off the record I don’t know who that is but I’ll ask around. Thanks.”

Then on October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks DMed Don Jr. again, asking him to “comment on” or “push” a story that Hillary Clinton had once said she wanted to “just drone” Assange. Don Jr. answered, “Already did that earlier today. It’s amazing what she can get away with.”

He then followed up with a question: “What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?” This was at the height of chatter that WikiLeaks had a major batch of anti-Clinton material ready. However, there is no indication that WikiLeaks answered this question from Don Jr. or gave him any advance information that it was Podesta’s emails that were coming. The group sent him a couple more messages, but there are no more known responses from Don Jr.

5) Roger Stone’s several contacts with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks: Roger Stone is a longtime Republican operative with a reputation for dirty tricks and a decades-long relationship with Donald Trump. Stone was only an official Trump campaign adviser briefly, departing the operation in early August 2015 after clashing with other staffers. But he remained in Trump’s orbit and, to some extent, in communication with the candidate himself afterward.

Both in public and in private, Stone was fixated on the hackings and leaks.

One associate of Stone’s claimed to the Washington Post that at some point in the spring of 2016, before news of the hackings broke, Stone said he’d learned from Julian Assange that WikiLeaks had obtained emails that would hurt Democrats. (Stone denies this.)

The initial leaks from Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks were posted in June and July. On August 4, Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser and longtime associate Sam Nunberg: “I dined with Julian Assange last night,” according to the Wall Street Journal. (Stone says this was a joke and flight records prove he wasn’t in London then.)

The day after that email, on August 5, Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer’s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued Russia probably wasn’t responsible. He also tweeted that “Julian Assange is a hero.”

Three days later, on August 8, Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information. “I actually have communicated with Assange,” he said. “I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there’s no telling what the October surprise may be.”

A few days after that, Stone began tweeting at, and eventually DMing with, Guccifer 2.0 (who, again, has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer). Some of these DMs later leaked, leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange. The posted messages are mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive.

On August 21, Stone tweeted an odd prediction: “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.” Many would later point to this — which came months before the Podesta emails became public — and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak. (Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone’s old friend Paul Manafort’s Ukraine work, he was merely predicting “Podesta’s business dealings would be exposed.”)

As October began, Stone took on a new role — as WikiLeaks’ hype man. He again claimed inside knowledge, saying a “friend” of his met with Assange and learned “the mother lode is coming Wednesday.” He tweeted: “Wednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.” And when nothing came on Wednesday, Stone tweeted, “Libs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming. #Lockthemup.” Assange published the Podesta emails two days later.

Immediately, there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved, which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group “has never communicated with Roger Stone.” The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward, complaining that they were “attacking” him. “The false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications,” WikiLeaks responded. “Don’t go there if you don’t want us to correct you.” Stone shot back: “Ha! The more you ‘correct’ me the more people think you’re lying. Your operation leaks like a sieve. You need to figure out who your friends are.”

What to make of all this? Stone was obviously in contact with two of the key leakers, and his own public statements show that at one point he wanted people to think he had an inside line on WikiLeaks’ plans. However, he’s repeatedly denied any inside knowledge or involvement, and we haven’t seen any clear evidence that he truly had such knowledge.

In any case, we might learn more from Mueller’s probe soon enough. “They want me to testify against Roger,” Sam Nunberg said this year, referring to the special counsel’s team. “They want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.”

6) Peter Smith’s hunt for Hillary’s deleted emails: Last but certainly not least, there is one more email-related subplot to the 2016 campaign — and it’s a weird one.

This one involves a separate set of emails: When word got out that Hillary Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department, she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators. But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails (about half of the total) to be “personal” rather than work-related, and deleted them.

Conservatives like longtime Republican operative Peter Smith didn’t take Clinton’s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value and questioned whether they could have contained scandalous behavior or criminal evidence. Their number included GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,” Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens. That will be next.”

It was around this time that Smith began an unusual project. He assumed that Clinton’s email server had been hacked and that her emails must be out there somewhere, on the “dark web.” So he reached out to computer experts and conservative activists, hoping to assemble a team that would track down those emails.

Smith didn’t work for the Trump campaign. But he is said to have repeatedly claimed to be in contact with Michael Flynn, who was advising Trump. One recruiting document Smith sent to cybersecurity expert Matt Tait contained the subheader “Trump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure).” It then listed several names: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Flynn, and Lisa Nelson. (Bannon and Conway have denied any involvement. The other three haven’t commented.)

Eventually, Smith gave his version of what happened to the Wall Street Journal’s Shane Harris. He said his team found five hacker groups who said they had Clinton’s emails, of which two seemed to be Russian. “We knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,” Smith said. However, he went on, he couldn’t determine whether the emails were authentic, so he ended up just advising the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks. No such emails have ever surfaced. Smith — 81 years old and in poor health — killed himself in May 2017, 10 days after speaking to Harris.

Smith’s effort appears to have failed. But Smith admitted he had tried to get stolen documents from groups he understood to be Russian government-tied. And then there is the question of Michael Flynn’s role — particularly since, per Harris’s sources, there are intelligence reports that say Russian hackers discussed how they could get leaked emails into Flynn’s hands. Much remains murky about this situation, but Flynn is cooperating with Mueller’s team as part of a plea deal, so the special counsel likely now knows whatever he does.

Mueller will likely bring charges in the email hacking matter. But against whom?

Last November, the Wall Street Journal’s Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber reported that the Justice Department had identified more than six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack and was considering bringing charges.

Interestingly, though, the report claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller had chosen not to take over the DNC hack investigation because it was “relatively technical” and had already “been under way for nearly a year.”

That appears to have since changed. Both NBC News and the Daily Beast reported in March that Mueller had now taken charge of the email hacking investigation. And the Washington Post reported in January that Mueller had added “a veteran cyber prosecutor,” Ryan Dickey, to his team. (Credit to Marcy Wheeler for flagging this point.)

So it’s a pretty safe bet that Mueller will bring some charges related to the email hackings. And judging by his past indictments, he’ll also use them to tell a story about what exactly happened, to the extent he can. There is, after all, a good deal we still don’t know — for instance, how, exactly, did the DNC and Podesta emails get from the hackers to WikiLeaks?

It’s important to remember that this is all just what we know about — there could be more that is still not public. It is certainly possible that several of their contacts with real or purported leakers and hackers listed above went nowhere, but it’s a bit harder to believe that all six of those separate contacts resulted in nothing of consequence.

Mueller has already gotten three people tied to Trump to plead guilty and cooperate with the investigation. What is he getting from George Papadopoulos, who got the earliest known tip that the Russians hacked the emails? What is he getting from Michael Flynn, who may have been tied to Peter Smith’s effort to get Clinton emails from Russian hackers? What was he getting from Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort’s right-hand man both before and during the campaign?

All three men have pleaded guilty, and we haven’t seen any of the fruits of their cooperation yet. They may be providing Mueller information about the hacked emails, and they may not. But it’s safe to say they’re telling Mueller a good deal that’s of interest — and eventually, we will find out what.","['https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IpoS-engME0-JfOOO2tmXY_L8LM=/0x0:551x193/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:551x193):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557273/Screen_Shot_2018_03_30_at_10.19.52_AM.png', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5AQu_5sau_MC2JauBlSJJuqr6A=/0x0:5760x3840/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5760x3840):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10559705/GettyImages_539527968.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skOFXz8QABlXzKk6OUIbJPvqvxw=/0x0:4672x3126/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:4672x3126):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10559359/GettyImages_936847926.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gP6QXCPSJrZyBMvfOjzY_KknfDg=/0x0:1100x353/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1100x353):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557707/Screen_Shot_2018_03_30_at_11.18.09_AM.png', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKZs8z3NF36U6EJmmgv1wOZJNX4=/0x0:4256x2772/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:4256x2772):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10236331/GettyImages_112281932.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uAjGnnKnpq7LYUZ0kxDV80EIqRY=/0x115:1600x953/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10559431/lead_round_3.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2ywcHG_HM2D6NjyPJ1XrAmo5b8=/0x0:1600x1067/1200x675/filters:focal(672x406:928x662)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59214949/lead_round_3.1522423683.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIrlIsp9vGpXCd1kbhABwl-1gTY=/0x0:465x409/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:465x409):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10535659/fullgmailalert.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqPDg8kbaobCPQprTruZdgYcwhU=/0x0:3000x2000/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2000):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557659/GettyImages_685307470.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mE29J7QS0oSICDFmH1pMCX9oj7Y=/0x0:3000x2002/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2002):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557261/GettyImages_607814904.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7ehW5by_j5XlLcsmWBMeWUxyfY=/0x0:3000x2060/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2060):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557271/GettyImages_699394226.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mcSZY3rdb6xoQHxaWrqGAH0giCE=/0x0:5472x3648/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5472x3648):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557359/GettyImages_925767866.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y-UP1F-DnCX7tNOAYkpK3uiPuK4=/0x0:2001x3000/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2001x3000):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10559473/GettyImages_508571622.jpg', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCxEjTwJYOBE7_HWQhSfsCZh708=/0x0:3120x2324/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3120x2324):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10557231/GettyImages_824672890.jpg']",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uAjGnnKnpq7LYUZ0kxDV80EIqRY=/0x115:1600x953/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10559431/lead_round_3.jpg,[],"['Andrew Prokop', 'Jul']",https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/2/17164266/trump-russia-mueller-email-hackings-dnc-clinton,"The hacked emails at the center of Mueller’s Russia investigation, explained",[],1522598400.0,http://www.vox.com,

Anyone else think it’s weird that Hillary Clinton hopped on a jet and flew to the Ukraine last night?

.

On Friday night, Clinton was seen with her husband Bill hopping aboard an aircraft to Lviv at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

.

This announcement comes after speculation and rumors that one of the indictments handed down by Robert Mueller’s grand jury were for her.

.

With recent news breaking that Clinton paid a Russian agency for information on Donald Trump, it is unsurprising that Mueller would target Clinton, nor is it really shocking that she would high-tail it out of the country just in case she is one of the people he is coming after on Monday.

.

The interesting thing about the Ukraine is that the country has no extradition agreement with the United States, meaning that she can not be forced to return if indeed she is slated to be arrested Monday.

.

“This seems the likeliest scenario,” former FBI agent Andrea Hawley told Fox News Saturday. “It’s worth noting that Hillary Clinton had no scheduled trips to the Ukraine or any reason to go there.”

.

Spokespeople for the Clintons have so far refused comment according to Fox and other news organizations.

The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”

“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”

After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“

“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”

The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

In September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”

“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sarah-huckabee-trick-or-treat-777x437-310x165.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stephen-A-Screenshot-640x480-110x75.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kaepernick-1-110x75.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vladhillary-696x364-110x75.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sarahbob-696x364-310x165.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Morgan-freeman-jail-hillary-678x381-660x330.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/29-Tomi.w710.h473-310x165.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stephen-A-Screenshot-640x480-310x165.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9aa741c284a663e5-110x75.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/goon-cover-1200x630-678x381-110x75.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601im_/http://www.snapusanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Morgan-freeman-jail-hillary-678x381-660x330.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171101100601/http://www.snapusanews.com/morgan-freeman-jailing-hillary-best-way-to-restore-public-faith-in-govt/,Morgan Freeman: ‘Jailing Hillary’ Best Way To ‘Restore Public Faith In Govt’,[],1509370274.0,https://web.archive.org,

“He was always talking about how people who believe in God we’re stupid and trying to preach his atheism,” wrote former classmate Nina Rose Nava in a Facebook post, according to the Daily Mail. “I legit just deleted him off my fb cause I couldn’t stand his post.”

“I removed him off FB for those same reasons!” replied Christopher Leo Longoria. “He was being super nagtive [sic] all the timd [sic].”

Oddly, Kelley lists teaching vacation Bible school as volunteer experience on his LinkedIn page, and his wife, Danielle Shields, was previously a teacher at a Baptist church, according to the Mail.

Another former pal described the sinking feeling he got from knowing he used to be buddies with Kelley, who on Sunday opened fire inside a Texas church, killing 26 people, including children and a pregnant woman, and injuring 20 more.

“It’s scary to know this psychopath has been in my house. I can’t believe I was friends with this guy and I literally would stay the night at his place when we were kids,” the former friend wrote.","['https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack-9.8/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif', 'https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0', 'https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/rhosls-index.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1', 'https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/4137224153001/5b140233-f2f6-4ac9-81a7-f9f8200acd0f/e0aa669b-9205-4e60-9e57-ee0bcb68d991/1280x720/match/image.jpg', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/171106-texas-shooter-church-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/norah-o-donnell.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/underwear-feature.png?w=260', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/171105-devin-patrick-kelley.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=389', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/shutterstock_1222121032.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png', 'https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brazen.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1', 'https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/171106-texas-shooter-church-index.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024']",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/171106-texas-shooter-church-index.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024,[],['Social Links For Max Jaeger'],https://nypost.com/2017/11/06/ex-friends-say-shooter-was-creepy-atheist-who-berated-religious-people/,Texas church shooter was a militant atheist,[],1509897600.0,https://nypost.com,
211,https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/news/texas-church-shooter-was-antifa-member-who-vowed-start-civil-war,"The gunman who opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, has been identified as Devin Kelley, an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by “targeting white conservative churches” and causing anarchy in the United States.

Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr said that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, according to reports by the CNN and the BBC, with the confirmed death toll expected to climb in the coming hours.

Witnesses report they saw Devin Kelley walk into the Baptist Church in the small town 30 miles from San Antonio at 11:30am local time Sunday, according to KSAT-12.

Devin Kelley, who killed at least 27 people and injured many more, was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers “this is a communist revolution” before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.

Sheriff Joe Tackitt confirmed to Wilson County News that there have been “multiple fatalities” and the shooter has been “taken down.”

Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included “Civil and social rights” and “Civil rights” as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons.

His Facebook page was taken down without explanation less than an hour after the shooting.

An eyewitness told CBS News that there was a heavy police presence on the road to the church, adding that they had seen severely injured people being airlifted from the area.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted to Twitter shortly after the mass shooting, saying: “Our prayers are with all who were harmed by this evil act. Our thanks to law enforcement for their response. More details from DPS soon.”

President Donald Trump has confirmed he is aware of the situation and said he was monitoring it from Japan.

Plagued by yet another atrocious season, along with the firing of their head coach, the University of Florida Gators are looking to cancel their annual rivalry game against the Florida State Seminoles.

When asked why they were considering canceling the game, a spokesman for the UF Athletic Department stated, ""Though both programs are struggling this year, dealing with injuries and academic disciplinary action, there is no need in embarrassing the UF Athletic program further by subjecting our already mediocre team to a game that would further humiliate the morale and enthusiasm of our student body.""

If in fact this game is cancelled it would be a disappointment to fans and alumni alike. We will keep you updated on any potential developments.

Как скачать и установить приложение

Мобильное приложение букмекерской конторы 1win позволяет делать ставки со смартфона или планшета. В нем можно зарегистрироваться, пополнить баланс и вывести деньги со счета. Проведем небольшой обзор мобильного приложения БК 1win, чтобы понять, как пользоваться программой на Android и iOS.

1win cкачать на iOS не получится, так как версии на Айфон не существует. Чтобы скачать 1 win на Андроид, выполните следующие действия:

1. Откройте официальный сайт БК на устройстве, на которое вы хотите скачать программу.

2. Пролистайте открытую страницу в самый низ. Там будет кнопка «Приложение Для Android». Через нее вы получите доступ к ссылке на скачивание. Нажмите на эту кнопку.

3. Появится запрос на загрузку файла в формате .apk. Нажмите «ОК». После этого просто откройте скачанный на телефон или планшет файл, чтобы установить его.

Возможно, ваша операционная система заблокирует инсталляцию, так как в ней не установлена функция установки из неизвестных источников, а таковыми считается все, кроме Play Market. В таком случае зайдите в настройки, дальше откройте «Экран блокировки и защита» и поставьте переключатель в положение «Вкл.» у пункта «Неизвестные источники». Таким образом вам удастся скачать 1вин на Андроид и установить на телефон эту программу.

Важно ! Возможность бесплатно получить официальное приложение дает только сайт БК. На других сайтах могут быть поддельные программные продукты, которые делают мошенники, чтобы получить доступ к вашему аккаунту, и вывести с него деньги (это лишь один из вариантов). Поэтому загружайте ПО с официального сайта.

Как зарегистрироваться в приложении

Регистрация проходит следующим образом:

1. Вверху появится кнопка «Регистрация». Жмите на нее.

2. Дальше можно выбрать один из трех вариантов.

Первый – в 1 клик . Это означает, что вы получите автоматически сгенерированный логин и пароль, после чего сможете использовать эти данные для входа. Но нужно выбрать страну, гражданство которой вы имеете и готовы подтвердить это предоставлением паспорта.

Второй – по e-mail . Кроме адреса электронной почты, придется ввести также имя, пароль два раза и дату рождения. Все эти данные должны быть настоящими, как в паспорте. Также укажите свой настоящий номер телефона. По умолчанию регистрация доступна для граждан России, однако вы можете выбрать другую страну, паспорт которой у вас есть. Для этого нажмите на поле, где изначально указано «Россия» и выберете другое государство. Тогда и телефон можно будет ввести в формате вашей страны.

Наконец, третий – соц. сети . Выберете одну из возможных сетей (ВКонтакте, Одноклассники и Google+), введите логин и пароль от аккаунта в них.

3. Прочитайте условия пользовательского соглашения (ссылка находится внизу). И поставьте галочку напротив пункта согласия с ними.

4. В конце нажмите кнопку «Зарегистрироваться» внизу.

Учетная запись создана, и вы можете пользоваться всеми возможностями, которые дает букмекерская контора 1win. В дальнейшем для авторизации жмите «Войти» вверху и введите свои логин с паролем, указанные при регистрации.

Как делать ставки: одиночные, экспресс, система, live-ставки

В приложении можно ставить ординары и экспрессы (в купоне будет несколько событий). Доступен режим лайв и экспресс. Чтобы поставить ординар, сделайте вот что:

1. Перейдите в раздел «Линия» на панели вверху.

2. Появится список всех доступных дисциплин. Тапните на тот спорт, на который хотите поставить (вы не можете выбрать сразу несколько вариантов). Вверху есть поле для поиска. Эта функция помогает не открывать все виды спорта, а сразу найти нужное событие.

3. Дальше откроется список доступных турниров и стран в рамках выбранных видов спорта. Выберете нужное. Для примера возьмем английскую Премьер-Лигу и матч Эвертон – Челси. Чтобы увидеть всю роспись, нужно нажать на надпись «Открыть событие» под названием встречи и коэффициентов на основной исход.

4. Нажмите на коэффициент события, на которое хотите поставить. Все они поделены на разделы. Для примера возьмем двойной шанс Х2, то есть Челси с ничьей.

5. Чтобы открыть купон, кликните по его значку в правом верхнем углу. Там еще появится количество событий, которые вы уже выбрали. Если вы хотите поставить экспресс, продолжайте выбор событий точно так же, как описано выше. Справа вверху появится цифра 2 или больше.

6. В конце введите сумму ставки в соответствующее поле и нажмите «Сделать ставку».

А вот как ставить экспресс:

Откройте раздел «Линия» на панели вверху. Выберете несколько исходов разных событий (от 2). Они могут быть из разных чемпионатов и видов спорта. Для этого откройте вид спорта (для примера возьмем футбол), затем чемпионат (пусть будет Премьер-Лига) и тапните по коэффициенту желаемого события. Зайдите в купон, нажав по его значку справа вверху. Поставьте переключатель вверху в правое положение, как показано на скриншоте ниже. Тогда станет активным экспресс. Дальше, как обычно, введите сумму и нажмите «Сделать ставку».

Чтобы ставить в лайве, выполните следующие инструкции:

Liberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.



Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.



Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.



One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”



“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”



What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.","['https://s3.amazonaws.com/gotchastream/topic-images/big/parenting.png?1642055688', 'https://nscdscamps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NSCD-SummerPrograms-FullColor-RGB-1-e1608996920728.png', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/gotchastream/topic-images/big/parenting.png']",https://s3.amazonaws.com/gotchastream/topic-images/big/parenting.png?1642055688,[],[],https://www.nscdscamps.org/blog/category/parenting/467344,UPDATE: Second Roy Moore Accuser Works For Michelle Obama Right NOW - Departed,[],,https://www.nscdscamps.org,
217,https://100percentfedup.com/just-wapo-reporter-broke-news-judge-roy-moore-story-criminal-history-faking/,"Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report.

The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.

One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore “took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.”

Corfman told the Post that Moore “touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.”

The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying.

“This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,” Moore said.

Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trump’s warning that Moore was less electable.

Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election. – Washington Examiner

Stephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of “faking” things like fake checks for instance…

According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be “fake news, after using mulitple “unnamed sources” in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.

Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.

Ms. McCrummen’s criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19 – False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.

Ms. McCrummen’s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states’ criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes.

We have just received information that one of the women accusing Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore of soliciting dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30’s is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones.

Deborah Wesson Gibson, aka Debbie Gibson, was named in the Washington Post article accusing Moore, and social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC.

Wesson Gibson is a sign language interpreter, who has interpreted at rallies for both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.

She has also vocalized fervent support for Jones.

Also, of course, she is a vocal opponent of Roy Moore and is clearly dedicated to him losing:

This is not surprising, considering the timing of these wild stories of Moore courting and even sexually groping teenage girls when he was in his 30’s. Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality.

Consider how suspicious this is – a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation – and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America.

The establishment doesn’t want Roy Moore, a man who can’t be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big! Buckle up RINOS…time to meet a real man!

Kayla Moore, Roy Moore’s wife, in an exclusive statement to The Activist Mommy yesterday, told us that “The Washington Post has been calling and harassing our friends and family, trying to find garbage. We’ve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him.”

Well, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore!

Go figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening.

Roy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him:

The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I’ve EVER faced!

We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.

I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values!

Our nation is at a crossroads right now — both spiritually and politically.

Our children and grandchildren’s futures are on the line.

So rest assured — I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!

The Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons they’ve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God.

This is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man they’ve hated as long as he has held public office. This fabricated story can’t hold water for long!

This statesman is going through the fires of testing for the survival of this nation. Let us all pray for him and give him our most generous support right now. Visit RoyMoore.org now!!

UPDATE 3:31 p.m. — The Executive Editor, Marty Baron, of the Washington Post released the following statement:

“The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post. The call’s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism.”

Another development involving the U.S. Senate race in Alabama. At least one person in our viewing area received a robocall seeking more damaging information about Roy Moore. Here is the text of that voicemail message received by Pastor Al Moore in Creola.

“Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I’m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5000 and $7000 dollars. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report. I can be reached by email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com, thank you.”

Pastor Moore says he’s baffled about who might be behind the message. He said he sent a response to the email address provided but it came back undeliverable. We also tried the email address with the same result.

John Rogers with the Roy Moore campaign says it’s the first he’s heard of this type of robocall. We contacted the Washington Post but it would be highly unlikely that a newspaper would offer thousands of dollars for information, damaging or otherwise. We searched and could not find a record of a ‘Bernie’ or ‘Al Bernstein’ who works as a reporter at the Washington Post.

Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, “In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem’s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y’all.”

Rich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.

Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, “Those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.”

Rich appears elsewhere in Brazile’s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich’s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.

Brazile talked about Rich on ABC News’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: “They don’t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don’t know what it’s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.”

Brazile had spoken publicly about Rich’s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, “Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth’s legacy to his country and party is shameful.” About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, “Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.”

Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, “Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family’s efforts to find Seth’s killers.”

In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton’s campaign headquarters seemed “antiseptic, like a hospital,” and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a “slave.” In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.

Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile’s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, “It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate’s health.”

Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/05/16/0516sethrichwikileaks.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/05/19/0519sethrichrussiatweet.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/05/23/0523kimdotcomsethrich.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/06/20/0620sethrichprofilingproject.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452/http://www.newsweek.com/donna-brazile-book-seth-rich-dnc-murder-conspiracy-702838,"DNC’s Donna Brazile Dedicated Her Book to ‘Patriot’ Seth Rich, Whose Death Made Her Fear for Her Own Life",[],1509986291.0,https://web.archive.org,
221,https://www.duffelblog.com/2017/10/bowe-bergdahl-wanders-off-court-martial/,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion, walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM, prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier.

Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer’s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal.

Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to “start a new life,” that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him, and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore.

“Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others,” Bergdahl wrote, adding, “I am ashamed to even be an American [deserter].”

Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl.

Staff Sgt. Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device, causing it to roll over. Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles, which they insisted were necessary to the search effort.

ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified.

Pentagon leadership is offering an unusual reward for information on Bergdahl’s whereabouts: $25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information.

Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years.","['https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_256,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadeabc44-cf54-453c-97ff-10380f38e4aa_400x400.png', 'https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_66,h_66,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Flogged-out.png', 'https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_96,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadeabc44-cf54-453c-97ff-10380f38e4aa_400x400.png']","https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_256,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadeabc44-cf54-453c-97ff-10380f38e4aa_400x400.png",[],[],https://www.duffelblog.com/p/bowe-bergdahl-wanders-off-court-martial,Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial,[],,https://www.duffelblog.com,

Scientists have been debating whether or not mantle plume could be responsible for western Antarctica’s instability, recent studies have shown some evidence of the claim, but some are still skeptical.

“I thought it was crazy,” Hélène Seroussi, the study’s co-author and scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a release.

“I didn’t see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it,” Seroussi said in a statement.

NASA has said that Seroussi’s study has provided evidence of geothermal activity underneath the world largest ice sheet, but scientists were still seemingly more worried about future global warming’s effects on the ice sheet.

NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot said western ice sheet collapse is “unstoppable” and could dramatically raise sea levels.

Mantle Plume’s are rivers of thin or melted rock that makes it’s way up towards earths surface and heats the crust above it, creating lakes and rivers of melted water underneath the massive ice sheet. Seroussi’s study showed a mantle plume pushes 150 milliwatts per square meter of heat up towards the ice sheet. That’s about two to three times the heat flux of regions of the world without volcanic activity.

A 2014 University of Texas study found western Antarctica was a literal hotbed for geothermal heat. Researchers concluded that “large areas at the base of Thwaites Glacier are actively melting in response to geothermal flux consistent with rift-associated magma migration and volcanism.”

The following year, a team of U.S. scientists confirmed in a study, the large amount of geothermal heat beneath the ice sheet, “The high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region,” the study found.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-214-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-214-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amnewslogo.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-212-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-212-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-215-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-211-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-213-100x100.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52-730x429.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-215-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-213-255x180.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-211-100x100.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52.jpg,[],[],//web.archive.org/web/20171228123849/http://americannews.com/busted-nasa-accidentally-destroys-every-climate-change-advocate-exposing-massive-truth-behind-antartica/,BUSTED: NASA Accidentally Destroys Every Climate Change Advocate By Exposing Massive Truth Behind Antartica,[],1510163737.0,https://web.archive.org,

Brig. General George Mason’s assistant Chief of Staff all but confirmed the report, saying that the matter has been turned over to those in charge of accountability. She hinted that this is exactly the kind of thing that could end up before Congress:

“This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the US taxpayer. Sourcres say the Taliban paid nearly a dollar a round. Someone in Obama’s circle pocketed that money.”

News Feed Observer’s correspondent Skip Tetheluda contacted Congressman Trey Gowdy’s office, who would not confirm or deny any of the allegations. Angela Corning, Gowdy’s publicist, says the Congressman would certainly be eager to look into the details if this pans out, which is looking pretty good right about now.

The ammo went missing in early spring, 2010, while Hillary Clinton was still Secretary of State. The issue was handled as an “inventory discrepancy” and swept under the rug.

224,https://web.archive.org/web/20171120042453/http://yournewswire.com:80/pope-francis-jesus-metaphorical/,"Pope Francis’s latest controversial statement – that “Jesus is metaphorical, not literal” – has pushed the Catholic Church to the verge of open mutiny, with multiple Vatican cardinals going on the record declaring Pope Francis is the false prophet foretold in holy scripture and prophecy.

The statement made by Pope Francis during Holy Mass in the Vatican on Sunday is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements uttered by the pontiff since he ascended the highest office in the Catholic Church, becoming the first jesuit pope in history.

Since assuming the papacy in 2013, Pope Francis has operated as a mouthpiece of the globalist movement, taking every opportunity to push the New World Order agenda. A short list of Francis’s most controversial statements include:

PREACHING THAT ‘JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN’

Pope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of “debasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself”, and “turning into Satan.”

Hardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it’s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.

Making matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ “made himself the devil, the serpent, for us,” according to L’Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.

PREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE ‘HARMFUL’

The heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that “a personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ” must be avoided at all costs.

“Having a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,” the pope said during the June 25 speech.

The unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.

OPENLY CALLING FOR ‘ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT’

In July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has “a distorted vision of the world” and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, “for their own good.”

The week before he also called for “a one world government” and “political authority”, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as “climate change.”

Speaking with Ecuador’s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control “for the good of humanity.”

France’s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a “globalist bulldog“. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis’s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis’s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.

Pope Francis’s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question – is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171120042453im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/surge-earthquakes-2018-80x60.jpg',

Not only are portions of Michigan being transformed into a “mini Baghdad,” but the state is also being overrun with rampant illegal activity, where the Muslim populace is constantly being busted in welfare fraud and disgusting mutilation practices on little girls. Now thanks to the hordes of Muslims taking over the state, Michigan can add another “accomplishment” on their list, as the Justice Department is dubbing what just went down in this state the “largest scam in United States history.”

Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nation’s laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nation’s laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the “largest scam” that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen.

The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more:

“Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions.

Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme.

One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare.

Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scam’s value.

‘Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets,’ Sessions said.

A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building.”

The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers’ noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Here’s an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jet…all bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer.

Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashid’s name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions.

More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit. Other Muslim defendants include:

Mashiyat Rashid, of Oakland County – controlled, owned or operated Global Quality, Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians, Tri-State Physicians, New Center Medical, National Laboratories, and Tri-County Wellness;

Yasser Mozeb, of Oakland County – allegedly received payments from Global Quality and Tri-County Wellness;

Abdul Haq, of Washtenaw County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians and Tri-State Physicians;

Joseph Betro, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians and New Center Medical;

Tariz Omar, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.

Mohammed Zahoor, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians.

Trump’s Justice Department isn’t messing around, as the defendants are being brought up on a plethora of federal charges, including five counts of health care fraud and health care fraud conspiracy. Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashid’s companies’ fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country.

We must continue to sound the alarm about what’s going right underneath our noses. This isn’t the first time that Muslims have ripped off Americans with fraud, and with the hordes of migrants that liberals keep fighting to bring into our country, stories like this will sadly become the new norm if the American people do not wake the hell up soon!","['https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a918cb246ff2ebc8080228eb92d032d2?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://cdn.libertasbella.com/images/lb-news-banner/Final.Version.-newspromotion-2-300 x 250.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/128f52732d5005cefbac8643169fb28f?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d59a7108fb54343a40cb645d93152427?s=49&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e646cb2e47d035fade4cabbd88279628?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2d667499035322f9cdc4e5c84596028d?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f2f672814a3982ae0d360b438133eace?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a709b1427b655f5f533949718fd064e0?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://www.theburningplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Whatfinger250x250.jpg', 'https://www.theburningplatform.com/wp-content/plugins/donation-thermometer/therm_,36_800_50000_FF0000.png', 'https://www.theburningplatform.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif', 'http://1csabj4ddrd61fgqez2e4nss.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/raid-cover2-700x340.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=48&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/47cbdbd0aa701f1cd1b59d20f6a3f9f4?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif', 'http://1csabj4ddrd61fgqez2e4nss.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shit-bird-700x392.jpg', 'http://www.birchgold.com/wp-content/uploads/greenspan2_100x100.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a2944210889cc3c402722471a55e28a8?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'http://www.birchgold.com/wp-content/uploads/gold_bone_100x100.jpg', 'http://www.theburningplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/emigrate.png', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/769084f2da2ebbc1e483af3f0e72adaa?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://www.theburningplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cropped-deepwater.jpg', 'http://1csabj4ddrd61fgqez2e4nss.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nba-700x389.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df45b81515d77b0872785debd574cc24?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=40&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/46278895b2bafd17e01aa6b6284c24f0?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://d1w4q6ldc8l0qo.cloudfront.net/media/AN/refer-a-friend/animated/05_250_250_dark_a1-min.gif', 'http://www.birchgold.com/wp-content/uploads/yuan_dollar_100x100.jpg', 'https://cdn.libertasbella.com/images/lb-affiliate-banners/TBPbanner1-03.png', 'https://media.giphy.com/media/XfbdgbiI0W0v5L0F5h/giphy.gif', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/feae86826c200c3e9b4e2826cdd185e2?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://cdn.libertasbella.com/images/lb-affiliate-banners/animated-burning-platform-banner.gif', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ade0a3cf62ed9705679f789c805632c5?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e585475e7150a5356d654891c48a1619?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6272544f92e13bb4a6e28244f31909f6?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg']",http://1csabj4ddrd61fgqez2e4nss.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/raid-cover2-700x340.jpg,[],"['Southern Sage', 'Mn Steel', 'Kokoda - The Most Deplorable', 'Mike Murray', 'Boat Guy', 'Colorado Artist', 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Anthony Aaron', 'Iska Waran', 'Abigail Adams']",https://www.theburningplatform.com/2017/07/24/412-michigan-muslims-arrested-in-feds-largest-bust-in-u-s-history/,412 Michigan Muslims Arrested In Fed’s ‘LARGEST BUST IN U.S. HISTORY’,[],1500825600.0,http://www.theburningplatform.com,

227,https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153/http://yournewswire.com:80/melania-trump-isis-barron-obama/,"First Lady Melania Trump has warned former president Barack Obama that if ISIS terrorists “lay a finger” on Barron Trump, she will “scratch his eyes out.”

Melania Trump’s warning comes days after ISIS terrorists used social media to call for the assassination of Barron Trump.

The terror group is sharing personal details about the 11-year-old boy on social media channels, including the private address of his school, and Melania Trump is pulling no punches, laying the blame for the rise of ISIS firmly at the feet of Barack Obama.

The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) translated the mass calls for the murder of President Trump’s youngest son on the popular “Telegram” app.

“Using the hashtag ‘handle the son of the mule of America,’ the supporter, who uses the name ‘Dak Al-Munafiqeen,’ Arabic for ‘striking the hypocrites,’ wrote: ‘Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington,'” according to MEMRI. “The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post.”

The rise of ISIS, funded and supported by Barack Obama, is viewed as another Obama-era failed project in in D.C., and Melania Trump has warned Obama that “if his chickens come home to roost in my house, if anything happens to my son, I will scratch his eyes out.“

“Supporting terrorists anywhere in the world can have serious and long term consequences,” Melania Trump said, “and if any of these psychopaths so much as lay a finger on Barron there will be hell to pay.”

Explaining that death threats from Islamic State terrorists have “already had an impact” on her son, the First Lady said “This is all on the head of Barack Obama.“

“I have always found it hard being polite to that man, considering all of the things he has done, but it will be even harder now.“

The influence Barack Obama had over the world was profound and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking at trouble around the United States and the world, you realize that Obama’s hand is in everything.

But as Melania Trump says, while Obama may be traveling the world as though he is still president, attempting to operate a shadow government to undermine President Trump’s presidency, Obama’s influence is steadily waning, and the terrorists he helped rise in the Middle East are in retreat.

We are on the verge of taking our country back.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/corrine-brown-prosecuted-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/melania-barron-protect-isis-696x464.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fukushima-radioactive-boars-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/beyonce-shapeshifted-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/melania-barron-protect-isis-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gop-2016-trump-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/harvard-vaccines-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CIA-wtc7-confession-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/europe-migrant-crisis-false-flag-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-06-at-7.49.56-PM-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/el_chapo_2_22_2014-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=/7lYk1a4eFf26C', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bernie3-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/melania-barron-protect-isis.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/autism-big-pharma-dead-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/snopes-shut-down-alt-media-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/antifa-terrorist-texas-church-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fiona-Woolf-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pentagon-powergrid-blackout-north-korea-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/white-phosphorus-syria-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8ba2706df68520b940ca8e5a895b2f69c44db4ec9b0c13d47ab102c3ae251e42-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alan-Dershowitz-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trump-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/kid-constellations-mayan-cities-80x60.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/melania-barron-protect-isis.jpg,[],"['Paul Stewart', 'Jackie Costa']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171125072153/http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-isis-barron-obama/,"Melania Trump: ‘If ISIS Lay A Finger On Barron, I’ll Scratch Obama’s Eyes Out’",[],1511455711.0,https://web.archive.org,

The boys were only advised ""not to be victimized"" the report further states.

The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.

Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 — $8,832.73 per month — according to public records.

Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera “has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‘n*ggers'”. One of Nucera’s officers “made numerous recordings” of Nucera that “contained extremely offensive racist comments” over the course of a year because he was “alarmed” by Nucera’s racism, according to the affidavit.

The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn’t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police “escalated into a physical struggle,” that both teens “resisted arrest” and that one of the officers used pepper spray.

After both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old’s head and slammed it “into the right side of the metal doorjamb,” according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old’s head make “a loud thud” as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn’t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had “stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.” The use of force wasn’t reported to the department.

Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was “f*cking tired” of African-Americans.

“I’ll tell you what, it’s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,” Nucera allegedly said. “And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,” he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl’s aunt, who was present at the arrest. “Fucking nipple hanging bitch. I’m so tired of them, man.”

Nucera allegedly said that black people should “stay the fuck out of Bordentown” and referred to the 18-year-old as “fucking little, fucking n****r.”

In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to “put my hands” on him.

“These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,” Nucera allegedly said. “They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I’m tired of it.”

“The conduct alleged is shocking,” acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.

“It’s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.”

Nucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.",['https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849im_/https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg'],https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849im_/https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg,[],['Nicole James'],https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849/https://www.truthexam.com/2017/11/new-jersey-police-chief-says-black-people-no-value-executed/,New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People ‘Have No Value’ And Should All Be Executed,[],1509643512.0,https://web.archive.org,

The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.

Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.

The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply.

When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton’s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “never intervened ... on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter.”

In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom’s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.

“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.

The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.

That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.

But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.

Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.

Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.

Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.

Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.

His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.

In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.

“As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.

“Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.

Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.

The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.

One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.

Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.

But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.

The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.

By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.

The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.

The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.

On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.

Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.

“I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.

Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersWashington's playing with a weak hand in the Ukraine crisis House GOP members introduce legislation targeting Russia over Ukraine Corporations seek to rebuild bridges with GOP objectors ahead of midterms MORE (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal.

“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”

Big mistake. Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” that she added “notes,” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

GMA : “Nelson says she did make notes to [Moore’s] inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore.” ABC HOST: “Beverly, he did sign your yearbook.” TRENDING: BOMBSHELL: Veritas Documents Reveal DC Bureaucrats Had Evidence Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine Were Effective in Treating COVID -- BUT HID THIS FROM PUBLIC NELSON: “He did sign it.” ABC HOST: “And you made some notes underneath?” NELSON: “Yes.”

As The Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft reported, there are growing calls that Gloria Allred and Beverly Nelson should be charged with fraud.

And in case you missed it… The Gateway Pundit has previously posted on the several discrepancies with Beverly Nelson’s press conference.

Following The Gateway Pundit’s viral story on Judge Roy Moore’s alleged signature inside accuser Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook, more evidence suggested it was a forgery.

CNN published photos of the signature showing two different inks.

The signature says “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.”

Strangely, “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy,” is written in black ink, while “Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House,” is in blue ink.

Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin. Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud.","['https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=GQy+u1Fx9f207i',

The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.

More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.

The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.

A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis’s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “Beth” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.

Lewis’s tweet read, “A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.”

A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????

In later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney’s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.

JustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis’s tweet. She stated that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “make things harder” for real victims.

Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “find out” the truth. He also stated that “Jean,” who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.

Bradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.

Lewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but “Jean” didn’t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.

“Can’t blame her with FBI in stories every day,” Lewis added.

It is important that while these allegations haven’t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.

Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.

Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated, “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.”

The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.

Let’s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171211235903im_/http://eveningw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/roy-moore-678x380.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171211235903im_/http://eveningw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/roy-moore.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171211235903im_/http://eveningw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/roy-moore.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171211235903/http://eveningw.com/breaking-woman-says-offered-big-money-washington-post-accuse-roy-moore-misconduct/,Breaking: Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of Misconduct,[],1510584829.0,https://web.archive.org,

Allred dragged out discredited Moore accuser Beverly Nelson to Good Morning America to hit Judge Roy Moore one last time before Tuesday’s vote.

Nelson admitted on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday that she tampered with and added “notes” to what she claims is Moore’s signature inside her yearbook.

The story is solid. The statements were made by Beverly Nelson this morning. The yearbook signature has been discredited as reported by ABC’s GMA this morning.

But after we posted the story this morning Facebook shut down our story.

The far left website Politifact said our story was not accurate and Facebook the shut it down. No one will be able to see our story on Facebook.

Breitbart wrote a similar post and it was also blocked by Facebook.

238,https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/breaking-trump-fires-deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-raising-questions-over-muellers-fate/,"WASHINGTON — Rod Jay Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice has been removed from his office.

Nearly everyone who knows him seems to agree that Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General and the official overseeing the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia, has a reputation for integrity.

Rod who is described by Jim Trusty, the former head of the Justice Department’s organized-crime division as a prosecutor, not a persecutor, had sought earlier to protect his good image by not taking a hastened decision to fire anyone without justifiable reasons.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Mueller’s probe, so the only possible way is to throw the Justice Department into upheaval by firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who only holds the key Mueller’s expulsion.

Only the person acting as attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein who was on matters related to the probe, could fire Mueller, and he said he won’t do it without “good cause.” So Trump would first had to purge the upper ranks of the Justice Department until he finds someone willing to follow his orders and dismiss the special counsel.

Conflicting reports claim Rosenstein had resigned but it’s understood that Donald Trump made the decision to remove him after a review from his chief of staff, John Kelly.

UNDER the best of circumstances—when America has a president who is disciplined, willing to hear harsh but necessary truths and loyal to those he trusts—the post of Attorney General is “perhaps one of the most powerful job in Washington”, according to Loretta Lynch. Loretta Elizabeth Lynch, an American attorney who served as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015 to succeed Eric Holder. Loretta Lynch, a political giant who held that post for Barack Obama said, under ideal conditions, it is also the “toughest job in government.”

Rosenstein, the hapless establishment Republican ousted as Deputy Attorney General on Monday December 4, 2017 lasted a smidgeon over few days. After days of increasingly public concerns over the likelihood of Mueller’s dismissal by Trump and amidst Trump’s former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, Mr Rosenstein is being replaced by Neil Gorsuch, who was recently nominated by Trump for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court.

The reshuffle puts Mr Rosenstein out of his misery and confirms Mr Trump’s fondness for surrounding himself with tough-as-nails generals, who already fill several top jobs in his government. It ends the fear of Trump administration being damaged by Flynn’s plea to Mueller’s investigation team.

These are not anything like ideal circumstances for Mr Neil Gorsuch. New holder of the toughest job in government, the ex-clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992, and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, from 1993 to 1994. He currently was serving as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. How long Mr Neil Gorsuch lasts is anyone’s guess. If he only emerges with his dignity intact and adhere to the orders and principles of Trump’s administration, he will have done better than his predecessor.

President Donald Trump’s interview with the New York Times on Wednesday stirred speculation he might consider firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller for investigating Trump’s business dealings as part of the Russia probe.

But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Mueller’s probe. Firing the Deputy Attorney General simply means setting off a chain-reaction that would throw the Justice Department into upheaval and consequently reaching his target to fire Robert Mueller under his dictatorship.

He’d certainly begun by dismissing Rosenstein, whose political loyalties Trump questioned in the Times interview on Wednesday in which he also warned Mueller against broadening his investigation. Such a scenario would parallel President Richard Nixon’s 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre,” when Nixon forced out the top two officials in the Justice Department in order to oust the Watergate special counsel.

“I don’t think that’s politically survivable, and it’s not clear how much collateral damage he will do, putting himself into a position to have somebody fire Mueller,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island.

Expanding Investigation

Mueller’s investigation has expanded to examine a broad range of transactions involving the president’s businesses, including dealings by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg News. Trump told the Times that if Mueller examined his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia he’d consider it “a violation.”

“There is no possible way anybody at the White House could be seriously thinking about firing Mueller,” said Senate Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican. “I don’t even want to comment on that because that’s so far out of bounds it couldn’t possibly be a serious discussion.”

Undercutting Mueller

Trump has indicated he would try to undercut Mueller’s credibility. In the New York Times interview, Trump said Mueller has “many other conflicts that I haven’t said, but I will at some point.”

Separately, the Washington Post reported Thursday night that Trump’s legal team was exploring ways to question Mueller by building a case that he has conflicts of interest in overseeing the investigation. The Post also cited one unidentified person familiar with the effort as saying that Trump has asked his advisers about his authority to grant pardons to aides, family members or even himself.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Houson.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ads.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GTU.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sav.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/45.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wr.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/AMT.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wr.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BB.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/45.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sav.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sd.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jk-1.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KOB.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GTU.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ads.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jk-1.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i2.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KOB.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BB.jpg?resize=300%2C180', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3.jpg?resize=1000%2C600', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i0.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sd.jpg?resize=80%2C80', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/AMT.jpg?resize=300%2C180']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703im_/https://i1.wp.com/houstonchronicle-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3.jpg?resize=1000%2C600,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171228192703/http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/breaking-trump-fires-deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-raising-questions-over-muellers-fate/,"BREAKING: Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Mueller’s fate",[],1451690263.0,https://web.archive.org,

240,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/,"Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.

According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.

While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.

Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes.

Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.

“At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.”

Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.

The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death.

Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.

The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.","['https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/saudibacon-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/psmmurders-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/drunkworker-180x101.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a80b974e33cdddf8ed513db82d4f6042?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6f73721764d9bdbd20ed91a50caf9bca?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squirrelman3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sub-180x101.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flamegame-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oldalienprobes-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afghansheep-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rushmorerescue-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mermaidrape3-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brosis-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dogcatcher-180x101.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d96e5b9017be2f453584c5e9149a51?s=70&d=mm&r=g', 'http://worldnewsdailyreport.com//worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morguedeath.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voodoohairdresser-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/manurevilla2-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pizzaman-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TSAflashlight-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deadmother-120x67.jpg', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/themes/mh_newsdesk/images/factsdontmatter3.png', 'https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/snowmenpervert-180x101.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb8ef1441b97e1436ec724ea791f44db?s=70&d=mm&r=g']",https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg,[],['Barbara Jennnings'],https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/,Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap,[],1488376082.0,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com,
241,http://inshapetoday.com/now-official-fda-announced-vaccines-causing-autism/,"According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.

These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.

In this sense, it should be noted that:

Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.

What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?

According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.

What is the content of these two growth mediums?

Mueller and Miller medium contains:

Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.

While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:

Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.

The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.

“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.

You might be wondering:

Why some of the doctors don’t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?

That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.

To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!

It’s time for Congress to rescind the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.

It’s about time vaccines are publicly acknowledged by the feds and the media for all the health damages they have caused. Just check out the CDC’s VAERS reports and the vaccine damage payouts by the HHS/HRSA. According to a new report published on March 1, 2017, by the department of health and human services of the United States, about $ 3,363,282,409.21 have been paid for vaccine adverse reactions and deaths from 1989 to 2017 so far.

Тhis is a very controversial topic. Seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have.

According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a “van full of illegals” who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore’s opponent Doug Jones.

“Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. “The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”

Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.

This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.

All but one of the men were “undocumented” immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.

How many other dirty tricks will be exposed?","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ssas-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6da99efe1851b0b28fc6237913f8b88b?s=125&d=monsterid&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/notfionadourif-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ssas-1024x538.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rated-S.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fakenewscnn-326x245.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934im_/http://nofakenews.online/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ssas-1024x538.jpg,[],"['About William', 'Truthteller']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171213122934/http://nofakenews.online/update-van-full-of-illegals-caught-voting-at-multiple-alabama-polling-locations/,UPDATE: Van Full Of Illegals Caught Voting At Multiple Alabama Polling Locations,[],,https://web.archive.org,

.

The alleged affair between Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his daughter’s best friend from high school has been confirmed by the girl’s mother and by medical records obtained by subpoena from Planned Parenthood. The young girl, just 16-years-old when she was seduced by Schumer, committed suicide before her 20th birthday.

.

Schumer’s daughter, Lisa, first broke the story because she thought her dad was being a “hypocrite about the Roy Moore scandal.” Schumer has been one of the most vocal opponents of Judge Moore’s Senate run on the grounds of some fantasy tale told by a woman who we’re expected to believe can remember details from 1977 like it was yesterday, even though she managed to forget for 40 years.

.

What will end up being the nail in Schumer’s coffin is the report from Planned Parenthood showing that Schumer paid for not one but two abortions and was the “responsible party” who picked the girl up from the murder clinic when she was done. Schumer’s own wife, Kaitlyn, paid the girl’s mother nearly $2 million to go away. Until now, she was happy to stay in the shadows:

.

“Now that the story is public and my daughter isn’t the one who did wrong, I can finally grieve and she can finally rest.”

.

Schumer might want to consider paying her a little bit more money before she opens up completely. He is expected to resign over the allegations as soon as Congress returns from Christmas break.

Isn’t it most of the time, when someone like Schumer always pointing out other people’s misdeeds is most likely guilty of the same act’s he’s calling out?","['http://www.usacarry.com/data/avatars/m/50/50420.jpg?1619533262', 'http://www.usacarry.com/data/avatars/m/51/51316.jpg?1619533271', 'https://www.usacarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/favicon.ico', 'http://www.usacarry.com/data/avatars/s/13/13497.jpg?1623307731', 'https://www.usacarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/concealed-carry-1-1.png', 'http://www.usacarry.com/data/avatars/m/76/76241.jpg?1619533425', 'http://www.usacarry.com/data/avatars/s/84/84461.jpg?1630341960']",https://www.usacarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/favicon.ico,[],[],https://forums.usacarry.com/threads/chuck-schumers-steamy-affair-with-a-high-school-cheerleader-confirmed.63339/,Chuck Schumer’s Steamy Affair With A High School Cheerleader Confirmed,[],1512971785.0,http://www.usacarry.com,

247,https://www.ravinderbhalla.com/about/,"Ravi Bhalla was elected Hoboken’s 39th Mayor on November 7, 2017 out of a field of six candidates. Born and raised in New Jersey, Mayor Bhalla is a 17 year resident of Hoboken and eight year member of the Hoboken City Council.

He received his undergraduate education from the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a B.A. in Political Psychology. Upon graduation, he attended the London School of Economics (L.S.E.) in the United Kingdom and received a Master of Science degree in Public Administration and Public Policy, and also earned a Juris Doctor Degree from Tulane Law School in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Ravi first set his roots in Hoboken at the age of 26, a bachelor fresh out of law school starting his first job at a small law firm in Newark, New Jersey. Ravi earned national recognition in the New York Times for his legal advocacy after suffering a violation of his own constitutional and civil rights during a jail visit to a client. The incident motivated Ravi to lead a successful campaign to reform the federal government’s visitation policies at correctional facilities nationwide.

Ravi married his wife Bindya, and they had two children, Arza and Shahbegh. It was during this time that Hoboken’s local government was in dire straits. He observed and witnessed mismanaged government at the local level, including a government budget that was underfunded and overspent by $12 million, a state takeover of Hoboken, and a 70% spike in municipal taxes in a single year.

Ravi ran for Council alongside Mayor Zimmer and worked tirelessly to get their message out of restoring honesty, professionalism and fiscal responsibility to Hoboken. Out of twelve candidates vying for 3 council-at-large positions, Ravi received the highest number of votes, as a first time candidate for office.

Once in office, Ravi worked hard alongside Mayor Zimmer and his council colleagues to establish tangible reforms to the way government is run in Hoboken. Municipal taxes were reduced and Hoboken’s finances were put on a responsible long-term path. The City’s bond rating was improved from junk bond status in 2009 to AA+ in 2013, the second highest rating, and had a responsible cash surplus for the first time in years.

Ravi was a leading voice on the council for securing the necessary funding for Hoboken’s second flood pump in Northwest Hoboken, advocated with Mayor Zimmer for the addition of 9 acres of open space, ensured our parks were built with detention systems to help alleviate flooding, voted to add progressive transportation options including corner cars and bike share, and played a large role in saving the hospital from closing in 2013, preserving more than 1,200 jobs and relieving taxpayers of a $52 million bond guarantee. Ravi currently sits as a co-chair of the City’s Rebuild by Design project, in which the City was awarded $230 million to comprehensively protect Hoboken from storm surge events like Superstorm Sandy.

Ravi served as Council President from 2011-2012 and Council Vice-President from 2010-2011 & 2013-2014 and was Chairman of the Hoboken Democratic Party from 2010-2011. Prior to his service as a Councilman, Mr. Bhalla served as a local Democratic Committeeman for the 2nd Ward, 3rd District of Hoboken from 2007-2009.

Ravi and his wife Bindya reside on Garden Street with their two children, Arza Kaur, age 10 and Shabegh Singh, age 5.","['https://www.ravinderbhalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ravi-and-Dawn-300x253.jpg', 'https://www.ravinderbhalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/800px-Hoboken3.jpg', 'https://www.ravinderbhalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ravi-Logo-orange-mayor.svg']",https://www.ravinderbhalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/800px-Hoboken3.jpg,[],[],https://www.ravinderbhalla.com/about/,About Mayor Bhalla,[],,https://www.ravinderbhalla.com,

RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:

Dear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can’t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian

What that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.

The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.

They can never just admit when they lost.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://defense-usa.xyz/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Trump20UN20speech20AP1-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/183-678x3811-100x70.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/82-678x3811-100x70.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GADjesse1-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/aaa-678x3812.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1861-100x70.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95fc33d4d30c9fe9a0b66ef6525845e4?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GADjeff122611-218x150.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/aaa-678x3812.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229/http://patriotunited.site/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/,"BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K Votes",[],1513267200.0,https://web.archive.org,

252,https://web.archive.org/web/20171223124337/https://www.infowars.com/pier-39-terrorist-was-an-anti-trump-antifa-supporter/,"Muslim convert and would-be domestic terrorist Everitt Aaron Jameson, who planned to carry out a Christmas Day massacre on Pier 39 in San Francisco, was a supporter of Antifa and counted amongst his favourite news organisations CNN, BuzzFeed and Al-Jazeera.

The former US Marine was arrested after he told the FBI of his plan to carry out the atrocity, noting that December 25 would be “the perfect day to commit the attack” because Pier 39 would be crowded with people.

Media reports confirmed that Jameson “had recently been posting and liking pro-terrorism content on Facebook” and had expressed support for the ISIS-inspired Halloween truck attack in New York. He converted to Islam two years ago.

However, what those reports don’t mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‘liked’ numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.

Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.

He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‘Trump Resistance Movement’, ‘Things Trump Supporters Say’, ‘US Democratic Socialists’, ‘Progressive Politics’, and ‘Jeremy Corbyn’.

Some of Jameson’s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.

The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including ‘Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, ‘Islam – Religion of Peace’ and ‘Stunning Hijabs’, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.

Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.

As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.

A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled ‘European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists’ details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.

During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.

According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses. Members of Antifa have also met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training.

Given all this, it’s unsurprising that the Department of Homeland Security has formally classified Antifa’s activities as “domestic terrorist violence,” with federal authorities warning state and local officials that the group is becoming increasingly dangerous and confrontational.

DECATUR, Alabama –

Police were recently tipped off to a reported meth lab that was being run by Walmart employees in what they are calling one of the biggest busts in decades.

Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.

“The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.”

No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.

The announcement was released late on Friday Sept 8th in a press conference, that the famous candy, the original Reese's peanut butter cups would no longer be available! ""By October 2017 they will all be removed from the shelves!"" Manufacturer said due to the new versions and a severe decline in sales. It is no longer justifiable to continue producing the product. Originally there were plans to keep them through Halloween, however those plans have fallen through. We say goodbye to a candy icon. RIP Reese's peanut butter cups. Make sure to get you one before they are gone!

256,https://web.archive.org/web/20171202190652/http://ourvoiceny.com:80/trump-vows-end-winter-heating-assistance-elderly-disabled,"President Donald Trump and the Republicans in Washington D.C. are preparing to carry out their most heartless plan ever.

As winter weather begins to set in across the United States, federal politicians are reportedly making huge cuts to a crucial government program that provides heating assistance to the elderly and disabled. Under the GOP proposal, millions of American households will be at risk of losing heat this winter, as reported by the Independent.co.uk

Sadly, this is exactly what millions of Americans have been fearing. The Republicans are carrying out a major attack against poor people and senior citizens, all so they can give a few more tax cuts to their rich friends.

As Gray TV reported recently, “President Donald Trump proposed cutting the multi-billion-dollar program as part of his budget plan. Government estimates suggest six million people rely on it to heat, cool, or weatherize their homes.”

This is just the latest example of the Trump administration’s utter disregard for everyday people in our country. Time and time again, Trump has taken every opportunity he has to make life harder for the people in the bottom 50 percent of America.

The Republicans have spent years trying to destroy everything that makes America great. Now that they have control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency, they are ramping up their ruthless campaign to full speed.

It’s time for Americans to wake up and stand up to the stupid Republican politicians in Washington D.C. – enough is enough

Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:

“The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”

The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:

“Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”

The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.

It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:

“Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”

Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.

This rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States, but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them, DO IT. We don’t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O’Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn’t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.

Mike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work.

“The people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets, who make the costumes, who create the props, and in some cases, do the stunts and the special effects,”Mike explained. “And they’re not getting the bazillion dollar deals.”

It’s about time that these jerkoffs realize that they aren’t the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President, whether they like it or not, and that isn’t about to change.

Let’s hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didn’t win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trump’s goals for his time in office they would feel different

But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.

Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.”

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did.

If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.

Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

The Obamas have forged a close relationship with Prince Harry. Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared with the 33-year-old royal for charity events in Chicago at the end of October. The former president was overheard quizzing Harry on his relationship with Markle, an American actor, when he sat with the prince at the Invictus Games, a sports event for injured servicemen and women founded by the prince, at the end of September in Toronto. Prince Harry also hosted Obama at Kensington Palace in May.

As for President Trump, Harry's wife-to-be revealed that she was not a fan. In an interview on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore during the 2016 election, Markle said she might decide to stay in Toronto—where her show, Suits, is filmed—if Trump were to win.

And it is HUGE!

The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One Deal released on Friday. THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up. Unlike the leak with Manafort and his indictment (which had nothing to do with Russian collusion in the Trump campaign), America woke up to non-stop news about Manafort turning himself in. Click HERE to read more about that. Manafort has since sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Fast forward to today. Uranium One Deal has its FIRST INDICTMENT against Mark Lambert.

Mark Lambert of Maryland has been indicted for “allegedly paid bribes to a Russian Official so his Company could win highly sensitive nuclear fuel transportation contracts.”

The “11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.” This is serious. And it stems from Russian collusion in the Obama-era.

“The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.”

KUDOS to the Trump-era DOJ American’s can trust.

The hard working and honest DOJ team, under Jeff Sessions, made the announcement yesterday.

The team members are: Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBI’s Washington, D.C. Field Office, as mentioned in the DOJ statement.

Here is the Statement Below:

An indictment against a former co-president of a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was unsealed today for his alleged role in a scheme that involved the bribery of an official at a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBI’s Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement.

Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged in an 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.

The case against Lambert is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.

According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.

In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.T

he indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.

In June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The case is being investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. Assistant Chiefs Ephraim Wernick and Christopher J. Cestaro and Trial Attorney Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorneys David I. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of Maryland, are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs has provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Switzerland, Latvia and Cyprus for providing valuable assistance with the investigation and prosecution of the case.

The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters.

Prepared remarks for Sen. Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.

Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “We hold these truths to be self-evident...” So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.

As the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan’s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.

It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.

2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine “alternative facts” into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. “The enemy of the people,” was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.

Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase “enemy of the people,” that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of “annihilating such individuals” who disagreed with the supreme leader.

This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president’s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot’s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn’t suit him “fake news,” it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.

I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of “fake news” are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.

According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on “false news” charges.

Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president’s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.

No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.

Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don’t.

No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.

Now, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the “most corrupt and dishonest” media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.

And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.

Together, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.

It is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial – such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year’s inaugural.

But many untruths are not at all trivial – such as the seminal untruth of the president’s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate – to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all – the supposed “hoax” at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

To be very clear, to call the Russia matter a “hoax” – as the president has many times – is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.

Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth – so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.

Mr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.

Mr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.

But a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:

“In February…Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, “You can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.”

In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being “demonized” by “fake news.” Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote “laughing by his side” Duterte called reporters “spies.”

In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had “spread lots of false versions, lots of lies” about his country, adding, “This is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?”

There are more:

“A state official in Myanmar recently said, “There is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,” referring to the persecuted ethnic group.

Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised “fake news” legislation in the new year.”

And on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.

We are not in a “fake news” era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.

In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, “The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.”

Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press’s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people’s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.

What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:

“We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.”

Mr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.

We are a mature democracy – it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring – or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.

I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: ""What is truth?"" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled “Oh Say, What is Truth.” It ends as follows:

“Then say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,

For the limits of time it steps o'er.

Tho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.

Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,

Eternal… unchanged… evermore.”

Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

266,http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/369928-who-is-affected-by-the-government-shutdown,"Thousands of government workers are unsure whether or not they will be heading to work on Monday amid uncertainty about how long a government shutdown will last.

Uncertainty is the byproduct of a government shutdown, with its impact often hard to predict. However, clues exist in the last shutdown, which was in 2013.

Key services will continue, and many agencies plan to use carryover funds to remain open for several days. But each day the shutdown lasts adds to the pressure on agencies, government employees and civilian contractors, as well as Americans who rely on various federal services.

Employees considered “essential” will still be required to report to work should the shutdown continue, while those in positions deemed “nonessential” will be barred from coming in.

The White House on Friday pledged to minimize the effects of the shutdown on the American people, with one official noting that the administration has urged government agencies “to do as much as they can” within the law to maintain operations.

The push for departments and agencies to utilize existing funding to remain open suggests the Trump administration is hedging its bets that lawmakers can reach a deal and avoid a shutdown the length of one in 2013, which lasted 16 days.

Each federal agency has a contingency plan for a shutdown that is written with help from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. But the impact of the shutdown, which began at midnight when the Senate failed to pass a short-term spending bill, is likely to trickle down gradually as agencies work to mitigate the effects.

About half of the Department of Health and Human Services will be placed on furlough. Beneficiaries of programs like Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid will still receive services. The Food and Drug Administration, however, will take a hit, as it will have to halt activities like food safety inspections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue “immediate response work” on influenza, according to White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney Mick MulvaneyTrump's relocation of the Bureau of Land Management was part of a familiar Republican playbook Jan. 6 committee issues latest round of subpoenas for rally organizers The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Alibaba - To vote or not? Pelosi faces infrastructure decision MORE.

The National Park Service (NPS) will keep parks open, unlike in 2013, though much of its staff will not report to work. Services such as trash pickup and restroom cleaning will be halted, according to the NPS contingency plan for a shutdown.

Cybersecurity will remain a priority during the shutdown, as the government will continue to protect information technology systems, Mulvaney said Saturday at a press conference.

The Environmental Protection Agency will largely stay open during the government's closure, and the Labor Department will resume mine safety inspections.

Military personnel will be required to show up for work, but will not receive pay for as long as the shutdown lasts. Families of slain military members will experience a halt to death benefits as a result of the shutdown.

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel will continue operations, meaning travelers will see both TSA employees and canines operating in airports. The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) management of air traffic control will also continue. Flight delays are not expected and much of the FAA's safety inspections will continue.

The government closure, a result of Congress’s failed negotiations over a spending bill the last several weeks, has sparked both intraparty battles and fights between Democrats and Republicans.

The two parties have each tried to cast blame on the other for the shutdown, with the Republican National Committee invoking the hashtag #SchumerShutdown, referring to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerBusiness executives urge Senate to bypass filibuster to pass voting rights Former colleagues honor Reid in ceremony at Capitol Biden to meet with Senate Democrats in voting rights push MORE (D-N.Y.).

What happens next depends on whether lawmakers reach a deal, as members of both the House and Senate have remained in Washington, D.C., to work toward an agreement to open the government.

Leaders in opposing parties on Saturday appear to be at odds over a short-term resolution to fund the government. Both chambers returned to Capitol Hill on Saturday afternoon to work toward a solution.","['http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/schumercharles_071117gn2_lead.jpg?itok=VRl8FOT1', 'http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-footer.png', 'https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/thumbnail_1.jpg?itok=3f2WTPou', 'https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/defense_ussoldiers_110919getty.jpg?itok=HN02FCRb', 'https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/ca_packaging_istock.jpg?itok=MgegO3yd', 'https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dome_capitol_shutdown_011918gn6_lead.jpg', 'https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/article_images/coronavirus_icu_hospital_california_082721getty_memo.jpg?itok=0cKbPix5', 'http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-big.png', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10314615&c3=&c4=https%3A//thehill.com/homenews/senate/369928-who-is-affected-by-the-government-shutdown&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/trumpdonald_070117getty.jpg?itok=6xe4YR_0', 'http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/video_images/mulvaney.png?itok=GiruMfVE']",https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/dome_capitol_shutdown_011918gn6_lead.jpg,[],[],https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/369928-who-is-affected-by-the-government-shutdown,Who is affected by the government shutdown?,[],1516478111.0,http://thehill.com,

Mueller will also be forced to resign from his position as Special Prosecutor for the FBI, nullifying everything that investigator has uncovered as fruit of the poisonous tree.

Pelosi, who says her husband was well-aware of the affair, swears that Mueller was just a friend whose company she enjoyed on long, lonely working nights and weekends in Washington. The California “progressive” says her husband was afforded the same freedom to explore “pleasures of the flesh.” :

“We’re not interested in defending our actions or our values as human beings. I’m a public servant who will continue to serve until my health or my constituents say otherwise.”

Regardless of how much we hate Nacy Pelosi, she represents a Congressional District that saw a million fraudulent votes from illegal immigrants. She’ll hold that seat until she dies.

Mueller, on the other hand, is looking at a messy divorce, a public humiliation and the loss of his job. He’ll also go down in history as the man who had solid evidence against several Trump surrogates and allowed their cases to all be dismissed on a technicality. None of it would have led to Trump, but it still lifts a huge weight from his legacy.

Mueller is finished and will resign as early as next Tuesday at 4.

What is a Presidential Library and Museum?

Presidential Libraries and Museums promote understanding of the presidency and the American experience. We preserve and provide access to historical materials, support research, and create interactive programs and exhibits that educate and inspire. Presidential Libraries and Museums present vast archives of documents, museums full of important Presidential artifacts, interesting educational and public programs, and informative web sites. Presidential Libraries and Museums are repositories for the papers, records and historical materials of the Presidents. We work to ensure that these irreplaceable items are preserved and made available for the widest possible use by researchers.

Presidential Libraries and Museums give you the chance to see, hear, and participate in the events that changed our lives and made us who we are as a nation.

History

How did the Presidential Library System begin?

It all began with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the late 1930s.

A dramatic increase in the amount of Presidential papers led Roosevelt to seek the advice of prominent historians and public figures on how and where to keep not only his White House files, but also his earlier papers, book collection, and memorabilia.

Roosevelt announced plans for a new type of facility, a Presidential Library, on December 10, 1938. An organization was chartered to raise private funds for the construction of the building on Roosevelt’s Hyde Park estate.

On July 18, 1939, Congress passed a joint resolution accepting the new facility and agreeing to operate it as part of the National Archives. The Roosevelt Library was turned over to the Federal government on July 4, 1940, and dedicated on June 30, 1941.

The Roosevelt Library became the model for subsequent Presidential Libraries. Succeeding Libraries have been constructed with private and other non-Federal funds. A private, non-profit organization is formed to coordinate these efforts and provide support for Library and museum programs.

Once a Library is constructed, NARA assumes responsibility for its operation and maintenance in accordance with the Presidential Libraries Acts of 1955 and 1986.

What is the role of the Office of Presidential Libraries within NARA?

The Office of Presidential Libraries is the program office responsible for the overall administration of the Presidential Library System. This office provides budgetary and administrative oversight for the system, coordinates multi-Library and system-wide initiatives, coordinates the development and implementation of NARA policies and procedures, and represents the Presidential Library System within NARA. The Office of Presidential Libraries also coordinates new Presidential Library development and construction, major construction and renovation projects at the libraries and coordinates national programs linking all Presidential Libraries.

What institutions comprise the Presidential Library System administered by NARA?

The Presidential Library System is comprised of 15 Presidential Libraries documenting Presidents Herbert Hoover through Donald J. Trump.

Listed in the order in which they were added to the system, Presidential libraries and their dedication dates include:

How soon are the records of a former President open for research?

How soon the records of a former President are available for research depends on a number of variables. For older Presidential Libraries (Hoover through Carter, with the exception of Nixon), access to the holdings are governed by deeds of gift, and the papers are processed according to prioritized plans. These plans are often developed with input from the former Presidents. Major areas of current research interest and the timeliness of topics in the national arena are also considered. Nixon Presidential materials are governed by the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA), and material is reviewed in accordance with established regulations.

For newer Libraries (from Reagan forward), the holdings are governed by the Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978. Under the PRA, the records are exempt from public release for five years after the end of a Presidential administration. During this five-year period, archivists begin processing and preparing materials for release to researchers.

After the end of the five-year period, all Presidential records become subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These requests must be made in writing and cite the Freedom of Information Act and then be submitted to the appropriate Library by mail, e-mail, fax, or in person.

The Libraries whose Presidential holdings are governed by the PRA work to respond to FOIA requests from the general public. They process records and make them publicly available not only to requestors but also to anyone interested in conducting research on the particular topics covered by FOIA requests.

How many records do all the Presidential Libraries hold and how many of those are open to researchers?

As of September 30, 2016, approximately 238,000 cubic feet, or 88% of the nearly than 270,000 cubic feet of textual and nontextual holdings in the Presidential Libraries have been processed. The percentage of materials processed at the individual Libraries tend to follow a chronological trend. The older Libraries (Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman) each have processed more than 90% of their holdings, the middle Libraries have all processed more than half their holdings for public access, and the most recent Libraries (from Reagan forward) have processed less than 50% of their holdings.

How can a researcher find out what records are open at a Presidential Library?

Researchers can search archival records through the National Archives Catalog.

Each Library also has a website that contains information regarding their holdings (including finding aids and collection guides) as well as digitized materials from their holdings. If finding aids are not available online, researchers can contact the Library, for more information on the materials available for research.

Museum Information

Are the museums of the Presidential Libraries open to the general public?

Presidential Libraries and Museums are open to the general public of all ages. Each Library has a museum component that documents the life and times of its respective President.

Each Library charges an admission fee, with revenues going to support museum operations and programs.

The museums also host changing exhibits about particular topics relating to American history and experience and are open to the public year-round.

Many Libraries also have an active education component, providing programs geared specifically to students and often tied to local curricula.

The Museum parts of the Libraries seem to be favorable to the former Presidents, as they often talk about the positive things the President did while in office. Why is that?

The composition of the first exhibits in the museums reflect the funding sources of those exhibits. The Presidential foundations (private, non-profit support organizations) raise the funds and construct the Presidential Library facilities, pay for the core exhibits in each Library's museum, provide significant funding (and, in many cases, staff) for public programs and education programs, and (for George Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and all future Presidential Libraries) provide an endowment to the government to offset maintenance costs for the facilities. The National Archives ensures the facility meets the environmental and security requirements for a Presidential archival depository and provides the core professional staff who undertake the archival, museum, programmatic, and administrative operations of the Library. This partnership results in an array of temporary exhibits and programming in facilities across the country that illustrate the life and times of the Presidents, general topics related to the Presidency, and cultural topics, with the National Archives paying only a fraction of the costs of these resources. Another aspect of this partnership is that the exhibit themes are influenced by the organization(s) funding the exhibits.

While the funding source of an exhibit plays a role in its interpretative theme, it is also worth noting that the most recent Presidential Libraries have exhibits that feature contemporary issues and topics. The depiction of contemporary, or nearly contemporary, events in an exhibit comes with different challenges than the portrayal of events and personalities from a more distant time frame. Exhibits in the Presidential Libraries evolve as the themes transition from contemporary to historical. Examples of more critical interpretations of Presidents include the Truman Library’s exhibit on his decision to use the atomic bomb and the Nixon Library’s recently renovated exhibit on Watergate. Where the Truman exhibit can rightfully be lauded today for its balanced content, a more recent Library may well receive similar praise when that Library reaches the age of the Truman Library and reflects the perspective that only time and more historical research can provide.

In all our exhibits, regardless of their age, we strive to present engaging exhibits of the President and the American experience to the broadest audience possible.

Passport to Presidential Libraries Program

What is the Passport Program?

The Passport to Presidential Libraries program gives visitors an opportunity to purchase a special keepsake booklet they can take with them on their travels to Presidential Libraries across the nation. A visitor receives a commemorative stamp from the Library at the time of the purchase and can collect stamps from every Presidential Library visited in the future. Once they collect stamps from all Presidential Libraries, they may visit any of the Presidential Libraries for a special gift. The Passport book retails for $5.

How do I get my Passport stamped?

Stamps are available at each Library's admissions desk and/or museum store. We unfortunately cannot retroactively stamp Passports or accept Passports via mail for stamping purposes.

Who can I call with questions about the Passport?

Please direct all inquiries and feedback regarding the Passport to Presidential Libraries to the Office of Presidential Libraries at (301) 837-3250.

Funding

How is a Presidential Library paid for and funded?

A Presidential Library is constructed with private or non-Federal funds donated to non-profit organizations established usually for the express purpose of building a Presidential Library and supporting its programs.

Some Libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments.

The Library is then transferred to the Federal government and operated and maintained by NARA through its congressionally appropriated operating budget.

Some staff and programs at Presidential Libraries are paid for with funds from associated private foundations organized to fund the construction of the Library. These private foundations also provide continuing support for Library programs and special events, such as conferences and exhibitions.

What is the role of a Presidential Library foundation?

Presidential Libraries carry out a mandated program to preserve, process, and make available their archival holdings. As part of providing access, the Libraries and Museums provide outreach and educational programs.

NARA does not have sufficient resources to provide the broadest spectrum of innovative and insightful public, education, and information programs in each Library. Foundation support is critical to the development of core public programming for a Presidential Library.

Presidential Libraries and Museums, their web sites, and the scholarship they promote benefit in significant ways from private organizations established to support such programs.

In several cases, these organizations evolved from bodies chartered to raise money and construct the original Library building. In other instances, these organizations were formed after the dedication of the Library by friends of the President.

Just as the origin and development of these organizations have varied, their formation and operation take a number of forms. Some of the organizations encourage public participation through payment of membership fees. Others are non-membership charitable foundations and corporations. Several seek to support their activities solely through private contributions. Some foundations are run by paid staff, others are voluntary.

Also, it should be noted that, starting with the George Bush Library, all future Presidential Library foundations must provide an endowment to NARA to help offset facility operating expenses. This endowment is presented to NARA and is used by the government to support facility maintenance needs.

Why should taxpayers support Presidential Libraries? Are taxpayer dollars being used to fund these programs instead of taking care of important government records?

NARA’s mission is to serve American democracy by safeguarding and preserving the records of our Government, ensuring that the people can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage. We ensure continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their government. We support democracy, promote civic education, and facilitate historical understanding of our national experience.

Presidential Libraries support NARA’s mission by preserving and providing access to materials from a crucial part of our government as well as materials from individuals who have played key roles in our government. The papers and records created by, for, or about Presidents, Vice Presidents, and their administrations document the key decisions, policy and activities of the institution of the Presidency - the highest policy level of government. The documents and artifacts held by the Presidential Libraries not only inform society about the President as an individual and about his term in office, but also provide insights into the American experience.

By providing access to these holdings through our research rooms, our exhibits, and online we attempt to support NARA’s mission for the broadest audience possible. In our efforts to fulfill this mission we draw on the many partnerships formed between NARA and the Presidential Library foundations. As a result, many aspects of museum and public programs are, in fact, supported by private funds, although they are overseen by government professionals including curators, educators, and archivists.

Building Details

Who decides where a Presidential Library and Museum should be located?

The President, with advice from the Archivist of the United States, makes the decision about the location of his Presidential Library. In consultation with his family, friends, and associates, he usually selects from a series of proposals submitted by interested communities or universities.

Presidents have often acknowledged their origins by placing their Libraries in their hometowns. However, in some cases Presidents place their Libraries on or near a university campus. For example, the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum is located on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

Does NARA have any input into the decision on location or the kind of building the Presidential Library will be?

The former President or his representatives choose the architects, or an architectural firm/design team for the building of a Presidential Library and for the development and fabrication of museum exhibits. The President or his representatives are solely responsible for choice of the final location for the Library building and for the construction costs.

The Presidential Libraries Act (44 U.S.C. Section 2112 (a) (2)) requires the Archivist of the United States to promulgate architectural and design standards that apply to new and existing libraries “in order to ensure that such depositories (A) preserve Presidential records subject to Chapter 22 of 44 U.S.C. and papers and other historical materials accepted for deposit under section 2111 of 44 U.S.C. (B) contain adequate research facilities.” These standards have been promulgated to fulfill the requirements of the Act and to ensure that Presidential Libraries are safe and efficient to operate and provide adequate and secure research and museum facilities.

The Architectural and Design Standards for Presidential Libraries are a supplement to NARA directive 1571, Archival Storage Standards, and NARA provides the standards for Presidential Libraries to the architects and design team selected by the former President or his representatives.

Are there any limits to the size of Presidential Library buildings?

Though not specifically limiting the size of Presidential Libraries, the Presidential Libraries Act of 1986 mandates that Library foundations must provide an endowment to NARA upon acceptance of the Library facility by the Archivist of the United States. The size of this endowment is based in part on the size of the facility.

The requirement of a significant increase in the endowment for facilities over 70,000 square feet has had the practical effect of limiting the size of newer Libraries to less than 70,000 square feet.

What is the largest Presidential Library?

In terms of building size, the largest Library operated by NARA is the John F. Kennedy Library building consisting of 166,573 gross square feet on 13 acres.

It is followed closely by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum building consisting of 147,400 gross square feet on 29 acres.

What is the smallest Presidential Library?

The smallest Library in size is the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum at 47,169 square feet.

Holdings

What is housed in a Presidential Library? Do you hold the records of executive branch agencies?

A Presidential Library is a rich resource for a particular President and his administration, as well as for the times in which he lived.

The papers and records created by a President and his administration, as well as the materials created by a President during his life and career comprise the core holdings of all Presidential Libraries.

The papers and records document the personal and professional lives of a President, his family, close friends, and business and political associates, revealing the details about White House activities, a President’ s career, and a President’ s personal life.

Along with the papers and records, a Presidential Library contains thousands of feet of motion picture film and videotape, as well as millions of still pictures revealing all aspects of a President's life before, during, and after the White House. This rich resource of audiovisual materials may include home movies, official White House photographs, and audiotapes of Presidential conversations.

Modern Presidential Libraries are also the custodians of the electronic records generated by a Presidential administration in its carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, and ceremonial duties of the Presidency.

Additionally, a Presidential Library contains thousands of artifacts, the objects that document a life and career. Whether a gift from a foreign head of state or a cherished childhood memento, the artifacts provide a unique record of a President's life, in and out of the public eye.

NARA has a statutory obligation to care for and provide access to legally defined Presidential records as a result of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. This law vested the ownership and administration of Presidential records with the United States Government through NARA. This law applies to the core holdings of Presidential Libraries starting with the records from the administration of Ronald Reagan.

The holdings of the Presidential Libraries differ from the materials created by all executive branch agencies, the United States District and Circuit Courts, and Legislative branch agencies. The Federal Records Act provides the statutory framework NARA uses to determine what records from these agencies should be accessioned into the holdings of the National Archives.

Where are the materials of Presidents before Herbert Hoover?

Although Franklin D. Roosevelt established the first Presidential Library, his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, later established a Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa.

The materials of Presidents prior to Herbert Hoover are dispersed throughout the nation. Some are held by universities and historical societies, but a large quantity are held by the Library of Congress. The Other Places to Research Presidential Materials page is an excellent starting point to finding information on other presidents.

Unfortunately, the extent of Presidential materials in archival and historical institutions across the country varies considerably depending on the attitudes of the former Presidents, their families, and friends to the preservation of their documentary materials. Many materials were lost, purposefully destroyed, or dispersed to family, friends, and supporters.

What Presidential Library has the largest amount of holdings? What Library has the smallest?

The Clinton Presidential Library has the largest overall number of traditional holdings, with more than 38,000 cubic feet of textual and audiovisual records. The Hoover Presidential Library has the smallest overall holdings, with more than 6,000 cubic feet of materials.

The George W. Bush Presidential Library has by far the largest set of electronic holdings in the Presidential Library system, with approximately 80 TB of data including approximately 200 million email messages.

Laws & Regulations

What are the key statutes governing the establishment and operation of a Presidential Library?

Though Congress approved the acceptance of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum by the National Archives in 1939, the nation's legislative branch did not formally authorize the Presidential Library System until 1955 with the passage of the Presidential Libraries Act.

The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 codified the acceptance, in the name of the United States, of land, buildings, and equipment for the purposes of creating a Presidential archival depository, as well as the role of the National Archives in maintaining, operating, and protecting them as a Presidential archival depository.

The act was amended in 1986, establishing a limit of 70,000 square feet for the Presidential Library facility that will be provided to the government and a requirement for an endowment to offset the maintenance costs of the facility. The most recent update to the act set the endowment requirement for future Presidential Libraries at 60 percent of the overall initial cost of the facility.

What is a deed of gift?

A deed of gift is a legal document between a donor and an archival repository.

Prior to the passage of the Presidential Records Act in 1978, the documentary materials created by a President and his staff during an administration were considered the President's personal property to be disposed of as he desired.

Presidents Herbert Hoover through Jimmy Carter (with the exception of Richard Nixon) donated their Presidential papers to NARA through deed of gift agreements.

Deeds of gift include restrictions of materials for national security and invasion of privacy reasons.

What is the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act?

As a result of the abuses of governmental power commonly known as ""Watergate"" and the controversy that occurred over the disposition of the Nixon tapes and papers documenting these abuses, Congress passed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) in 1974. PRMPA transferred ownership of the Presidential historical materials of Richard Nixon to the Federal government, deposited them with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), and specified access restrictions to these materials.

The act also called for a commission to study and make recommendations regarding the status of the papers of all Federal officials, including those of the President. The findings of this study led to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, vesting ownership of the official records of the President and Vice President with the Federal government after January 20, 1981.","['https://www.archives.gov/sites/all/themes/nara/images/nara-print-logo.jpg', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/apple-icon.png']",https://www.archives.gov/files/apple-icon.png,[],[],https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/about/faqs.html,Frequently Asked Questions,[],1471296917.0,https://www.archives.gov,

In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.

The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.

Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.

Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:

“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.

While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.

Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”

Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?

DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”

DeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.

For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.

Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.

Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.

Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.

“The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,” Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.

The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in “good spirits“, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.

“It’s really shocking,” said Muncheez’s owner Gilbert Bailly. “We grew up together; he was like family.” –Your News Wire

Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton’s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton’s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.

Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to “side” with the Clinton Administration and he would “be the richest man in Haiti.”

He also demanded that Hillary Clinton “disclose the audit of all money” related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.

“Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.”

Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was “built by immigrants.”

Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE

What is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.","['https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/12/2nd-lt-Brittany-Ramos-DeBarros-filephoto-us-army-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1364040092-1-e1641993413847-200x151.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/08/Anthony-Fauci-eyes-raised-pointing-up-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/03/GettyImages-1231892472-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/07/donald-trump-speech-az-july24-2021-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/10/Kamala-1-200x150.jpeg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Kevin-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/AP_20065647577600-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/01/India-vaccine-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Joe-Biden-Rants-in-Georgia-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1237644898-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Hans-von-Spakovsky-file-Nov2018-osce-flickr-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/08/Joe-Biden-angry-fist-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1356217545-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/coronavirus-body-bag-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/AP20142278929585-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Mystal88-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Sarah-Stier_Getty-Images-7-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Shi-Zhengli-wuhan-lab-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/earns-saudi-aramco-june-28-2021-file-photo-saudi-aramco-engineers-journalists-at-hawiyah-natural-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/empty-shelves-warren-inset-getty-200x150.jpg']",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg,[],['Ian Mason'],https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/,"Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not ‘Built by Immigrants’",[],,http://www.breitbart.com,

Singer Dolly Parton: “Trump In One Year Is Already Better Than 16 Years’ of Bush, Obama ‘Put Together’, This Stupid Liberals Doing Everything To Impeach Him But We Standing With Trump now And Forever. Do You Support Her?

Dolly Parton has long been one of America’s most legendary singing and songwriting talents. Until recently, she was fairly liberal, and a big supporter of Hillary Clinton.

In a statement not long ago, Parton said she was inspired that a woman might be President for the first time in our nation’s history.

“We’re doing good,” she commented at the time. “We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect.”Recently, Parton saw the light and realized that Hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation. She now understands that Hillary is a liar; she’s as corrupt as they come.

Recently, Parton saw the light and realized that Hillary would be quite possible the worst person to be the champion for woman throughout the nation. She now understands that Hillary is a liar; she’s as corrupt as they come.

In a more recent interview, she called Hillary “nuts” and that her campaign has been “just crazy.”

The American News article used portions of a real interview Parton gave to CNN on 26 August 2016, presenting quotes from that interview inaccurately and out

276,https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357/http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/,"An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is “rigged.”

Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an “gangland-style execution”, hours after blowing the whistle on the “rigged Super Bowl” backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.

Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.

Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League’s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday’s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.

However Goodes went “off-script” in Minneapolis and was “physically removed” from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as “totally corrupt” and claiming the Super Bowl is “fixed.”





Telling reporters that he is a “football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second”, Goodes said “Football in America in 2018 doesn’t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.

“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.

“Football in America won’t recover from this.”

Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.

According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.

“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”

“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.“

“You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”

“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”

Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”

The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.

In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.

The only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.

How are games rigged?

According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.

“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed?

“Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? I’m telling you now, they don’t care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes?”

“The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes.”

“How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games?”

“Everyone is on the same side, that’s why.”

“These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They can’t open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast.”

Why doesn’t anyone speak out?

According to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear.

“Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed.

“It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl.”

“And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. “We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We’re exempt.”

Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/910984334202589186/LrIt_0SD_normal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://www.beaware.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shopsbusinesses-nfl-headquarters.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://www.beaware.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/27479952_10156463941410715_460628881_o.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/955215557543976960/pu/img/jPlLzqAbqId52RfH?format=jpg&name=small', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/econewsmedia-6.gif', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/plugins/custom-share-buttons-with-floating-sidebar/images/hide.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NFL-execution-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/plugins/custom-share-buttons-with-floating-sidebar/images/hide-l.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NFL-execution-678x381.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357/http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/,"NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is ‘Rigged’, Found Dead",[],1517414400.0,https://web.archive.org,

279,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/,"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.

Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.

Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.

In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.

The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.

A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.

“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.

Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.

The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.

But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.

The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.

Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.","['https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/12/2nd-lt-Brittany-Ramos-DeBarros-filephoto-us-army-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1364040092-1-e1641993413847-200x151.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty-640x480.jpg', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/03/GettyImages-1231892472-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/10/Kamala-1-200x150.jpeg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/hillary-queens-university-inauguration-AP-200x150.jpg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Kevin-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/AP_20065647577600-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/01/India-vaccine-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Joe-Biden-Rants-in-Georgia-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/GettyImages-1237644898-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/Hans-von-Spakovsky-file-Nov2018-osce-flickr-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/08/Joe-Biden-angry-fist-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/coronavirus-body-bag-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/AP20142278929585-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Mystal88-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Sarah-Stier_Getty-Images-7-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Shi-Zhengli-wuhan-lab-getty-200x150.jpg', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/earns-saudi-aramco-june-28-2021-file-photo-saudi-aramco-engineers-journalists-at-hawiyah-natural-200x150.png', 'https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/01/empty-shelves-warren-inset-getty-200x150.jpg']",https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg,[],['Katherine Rodriguez'],https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/,Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month,[],1517932800.0,http://www.breitbart.com,

283,https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751/http://yournewswire.com:80/melanic-trump-exorcist-white-house/,"First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from “the Clinton and Obama years” removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.

“I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,” Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.

“They cleansed the White House,” the pastor said. “They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”

After the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left – a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.

“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.

The White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”

“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”

Pastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.

In his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.

A Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.

In a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”

Later that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.

With previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/harvard-vaccines-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/melania-exorcises-obama-demons-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/us-spy-plane-sweden-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/flying-car-crash-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=/7lYk1a4eFf26C', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/melania-exorcises-obama-demons.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NHS-chief-exec-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/melania-exorcises-obama-demons-696x424.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/EU-army-agreement-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/internetarcade1-100528400-large-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/maxresdefault-2-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/syria-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/11.si_-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-17-at-10.13.03-PM-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CDC-doctor-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fbi-informant-hillary-russia-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/netanyahu-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Richard-Keenan-1-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/antifa-terrorist-texas-church-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lavrov-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bernie3-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chemtrails-madness-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ursula-Haverbeck-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/13-year-old-accused-rape-80x60.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/melania-exorcises-obama-demons.jpg,[],"['Freda Johnson', 'The Mechanic', 'Paul Metto', 'Andy C', 'Mathmom Feelin', 'The Hope', 'Duke Lacrosse', 'Itsrealandits Soon', 'Kevin J Lankford', 'Rude Richard']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180210142751/http://yournewswire.com/melanic-trump-exorcist-white-house/,Melania Trump Hired Exorcist To ‘Cleanse White House Of Obama Demons’,[],1518124801.0,https://web.archive.org,
284,www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/there-blood-everywhere-terrified-students-12029466,"WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Horrifying video captured during a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, shows lifeless victims on the floor

Inside the Snapchat bloodbath: 60 minutes of terror which left 17 dead, bodies in classrooms and kids 'full of blood'

Terrified teens ran past dead bodies and screamed in horror as they fled a Florida high school where a 'crazed' gunman killed 17 people in the latest US mass shooting.

Horrifying video captured by a student shows lifeless victims as teens were rescued by police and ushered out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.

Students and staff barricaded themselves inside classrooms - with one group hiding in a closet as pupils cried in terror - as the shooter carried out the Valentine's Day massacre with an assault rifle despite previous warning signs.

In the aftermath, one traumatised survivor described how ""there was blood everywhere"" after bullets were fired through classroom windows as the gunman stalked the sprawling campus.

Teens posted disturbing photos and videos on social media, with one showing students hiding under desks and screaming as barrage of gunshots echo through the building.

The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, with the victims including an assistant football coach who gave his life to protect students.

Today he appeared in court for the first time since the atrocity in Florida and will be remanded in custody.

Dressed in orange overalls, he bowed his head as the charge was read out to him.

A judge told him: ""I have something very important to tell you. You are charged with some very serious crimes.""

He was told he would be ""held without bond until further order"".

His lawyer Melissa McNeill said today after the hearing: ""He's a broken human being, he's a broken child.

""The sadness this community is feeling, I mean my children go to school in this community. I feel horrible for these families.

""And Mr Cruz feels that pain.""

All 17 families have been notified of the loss of their loved ones, police said in a briefing today.

The victims included students Jaime Guttenburg, Alaina Petty, 14, Martin Duque,14, Alyssa Al Hadeff, 15, Gina Montalto, 14, and Nick Dworet, 18.

Luke Hoyer, Carmen Schentrup, Meadow Pollack, 18, Joaquin Oliver, 17, Cara Loughran, Peter Wang, 15, and Alex Schachter were also killed.

Aaron Feis, 37, staff member Chris Hixon, 49, and science teacher Scott Beigel also were among the victims.

The FBI has now launched an ""extensive review"" into how the 2017 tip into Nikolas Cruz was handled.

It has also emerged that Cruz particpated in activities of white nationalist militia.

In a press briefing today, Broward County Sheriff said sadly there were copycat threats made at other schools today and they would be taking all of these seriously and would respond in full.

Officials in a press briefing today also revealed there were still bodies in the school.

Chief Scott Israel said today: ""There are some bodies that are still in the school.""

He said that ""today is the day of mourning"" after many lives were lost in the horrific incident.

On the investigation he said: ""We are not going to leave any stone unturned.

""We will interview every single student or person in that school who may know something.

""Law enforcement will do everything we can to make sure this person is convicted of all charges. We will make sure justice is served.""

Mr Israel later added: ""What about the rights of people who go to school with book bags - don't they have the right to be protected?""

He also called people in the community ""our eyes and ears"" and said ""right now, if you know anybody, this raises a red flag, don't just think about calling us, call us.

""If there's something in your gut that tells you there's something not right with this person, please say something.""

In the press briefing today, Governor Rick Scott said: ""We need to make sure this never happens again.""

He said: ""If somebody is mentally ill, they should not have access to a gun.""

Seventeen students and adults were killed and more than a dozen others were hospitalised in Wednesday afternoon's atrocity allegedly carried out by former student Cruz, described by ex-classmates as a ""troubled"" and depressed loner who was ""crazy about guns"" and had talked about shooting pupils.

Students had predicted Cruz would become a school shooter due to previous threats, his obsession with guns and knives and his unusual behaviour, it was claimed.

Police said the 19-year-old had previously been expelled from the school for disciplinary reasons, and returned with an AR-15 rifle - the same type of firearm used in many other massacres - plus a significant amount of ammunition and smoke bombs.

The gun was legally purchased, it was claimed as the motive for the attack - the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history - remained a mystery.

The atrocity began at about 2.30pm, with police claiming Cruz pulled the fire alarm and shot victims as they left classrooms before he blended in with pupils - pretending to be one of the terrified teens - and left the campus within about 25 minutes.

In the video showing terrified students fleeing after shots had already been fired, pupils scream and cry in a classroom where police crouch over a body on the floor.

An injured girl is carried out of the room by police and her classmates follow behind her and the officers after someone says ""let's go, come on"".

There are loud screams as students - including an injured boy grimacing and clutching his shoulder - pass bodies in a corridor and they are urged to ""run"" to safety.

Student Geovanni Vilsant, 15, told the Miami Herald that he heard gunfire when he was in a Spanish classroom and then saw three bodies on the floor as he fled the school.

He added: “There was blood everywhere. They weren't moving.""

A female student told Fox News of the distressing things she saw as police escorted her out.

She said: ""The police came through the hallway to get us and in the hallway, I saw a big pile of blood, like, kind of smeared as if they were dragged away, and I saw two girls probably dead in the hallway.

""And then, coming down the stairs, there was some more blood and outside the building there was another guy – I think it was a teacher – who was, [I’m] pretty sure was dead.""

Student Rebecca Bogart, who was in Holocaust class, told the newspaper that bullets shattered a classroom window and teens ducked for cover.

Rebecca, 17, said she got onto the floor and hid under a teacher's desk.

She added: “Four kids in my class were hurt. There was blood everywhere. I’m so glad to be living right now.

""I knew what gunshots sounded like, but not that loud or extreme. It smelled smoky.”

Sarah Crescitelli hid in a theatre class bathroom and sent a text message to her parents reading: “If I don’t make it I love you and I appreciated everything you did for me.”

Cruz allegedly wore a gas mask and tossed smoke bombs into a corridor before pulling the fire alarm and shooting people as they ran through the haze.

There was confusion when the alarm went off, as students and staff had practiced a drill earlier in the day.

The gunman went through corridors all over the campus, shooting more victims before leaving and blending in with pupils as they fled, it was claimed.

The local school superintendent said it's believed Cruz took an Uber car to the campus.

Cruz was allegedly carrying the gun in a duffel bag and had brought extra clothing with him, it was reported.

Student Matthew Walker, 17, told ABC 17 that the suspect was known to show off guns and knives.

The student said: ""He was going class to class just shooting at random kids. Everything he posts (on social media) is about weapons. It's sick.""

Another student, Eddie Bonilla, told CBS Miami that other students ""knew it was going to be him""

The student said: ""A lot of people were saying it was going to be him.

""A lot of kids threw jokes around saying that he was going to be the one to shoot up the school.

""It turns out that everyone predicted it. That's crazy.""

The rampage began shortly before lessons were due to end for the day at the school in Broward County, about 45 miles north of Miami. Tales of heroism began to emerge in the hours that followed.

School football coach and security guard Aaron Feis, 37, was fatally injured when he threw himself in front of pupils to shield them from the killer's bullets.

The football team confirmed his death on Thursday, writing on Twitter: ""It is with Great sadness that our Football Family has learned about the death of Aaron Feis.

""He was our Assistant Football Coach and security guard. He selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot.

""He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.""

Language arts teacher Melissa Falkowski hid 19 of her students in a classroom closet as the gunman went through the school.

She climbed in after them and they hid from the suspect until it was safe to come out.

In the aftermath, Ms Falkowski hit out at the US government and society for failing to prevent the massacre.

She told CNN: ""This is the worst nightmare that could ever happen to you.""

She added: ""We’ve trained the kids what to do, and the frustration is that we did everything that we were supposed to do... and still have to have so many casualties.""

Profiles of the victims, including Mr Feis, were also starting to emerge on Thursday, as students from nearby schools returned to lessons under increased security.

Student Jaime Guttenberg, 17, was confirmed dead after her parents, Fred and Jennifer, were unable to contact her amid the chaos and launched a desperate bid to find her.

Mr Guttenberg posted on Facebok saying his son Jesse had escaped unharmed but added: ""We cannot reach Jaime.

""If anyone has a child who saw or spoke to Jaime please call me.""

The parents were later given the heartbreaking news that their daughter was among the dead.

Her cousin Marc Pollack posted a tribute on Facebook, writing: ""This is a picture of our sweet cousin Jaime who was senselessly and tragically killed today at Stoneman Douglas High School.

""My heart is broken from the loss of this awesome young girl and the pain that our entire family is enduring.""

Terrified students ran out of the building, while others took refuge inside as bursts of gunfire rang out. Staff and students got on the floor in locked classrooms, with reports that the gunman shot through windows or doors.

Hannah Siren, 14, who was in maths class, told the Orlando Sentinel: ""The people next door to us must have not locked their door.They all got shot.""

Student Alexa Miednik said she briefly spoke to Cruz as she and others rushed outside after the fire alarm went off and gunshots were heard.

She said: ""As we were walking the whole class together, I actually was speaking to the suspect Nikolas Cruz, and as I was speaking to him he seemed very, I don’t know what the word I want to say is, but he was troubled in middle school.

""So, I kind of joked to him about it and said I’m surprised you weren’t the one who did it, and he just gave me a 'huh?'""

As the lockdown was lifted after the rampage, bewildered students and staff streamed out of the school with their hands in the air, passing heavily-armed and helmeted police officers wearing combat gear.

Twelve of the dead were killed inside the school, while two others were shot just outside. One more was gunned down on the street, and two other victims died in hospital.

The school, which has about 3,200 students, remained on lockdown for about 90 minutes before students were finally released and reunited with their distraught parents - who were anxiously waiting for updates - in emotional scenes.

Cruz - described by former classmates as a ""troubled"" loner who was obsessed with guns - was arrested just after 4pm by police in nearby Coral Springs. He was wearing wine-colored Reserve Officers' Training Corps polo shirt, black pants and black boots.

Police said Cruz, who worked at a local discount store and was attending a new school, was armed with an AR-15 rifle and had multiple magazines of ammunition when he was arrested without a struggle.

Brent Black, a former classmate, told ABC News that Cruz had previously threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school.

He said: ""About a year ago I saw him upset in the morning. And I was like, 'yo what’s wrong with you?'

""And he was like 'umm, don’t know.' And I was like 'what’s up with you?'

""He's like, 'I swear to God I'll shoot up this school'. And then I was like, 'watch what you’re saying around me', and then I just left him after that. He came up to me later on the day and apologised for what he said.""

Students told reporters that Cruz was familiar with the school's layout and had been involved in fire drills in the past, so he knew what to expect when the alarm went off.

Attorney Jim Lewis told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that the AR-15 used in the mass shooting was legally bought by Cruz, who lived with a family friend following his mum Lynda 's death.

A source told CNN that Cruz had purchased the gun in the past year after passing a background check.

Cruz's adoptive mum died in November at age 68 from pneumonia, while his dad Roger died from a heart attack when he was a younger boy, it was reported.

The couple had reportedly adopted Cruz on the day he was born, along with his biological brother, Zachary.

Speaking on behalf of the family friend, Lewis said: “It was his gun. The family made him keep it in a locked gun cabinet in the house but he had a key.”

Lewis said the family let Cruz move in around Thanksgiving, gave him a room and urged him to attend adult education classes.

The lawyer said Cruz was ""depressed"" following his mum's death, and the family who took him in ""didn’t see this coming"".

A relative told US media that Cruz had been diagnosed with autism.

Following his arrest, Cruz was questioned for hours by detectives before he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Officers searched a number of properties linked to the suspect, including the home where he was living with a family friend.

The FBI and Department of Homeland Security were assisting with the investigation.

Former classmates claim he had previously threatened to shoot up the school, he had talked about shooting animals and he was obsessed with guns.

They also said he had a bad school record and was expelled from Douglas High School after getting into a fight with his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.

Broward County School District Superintendent Robert Runcie told reporters he did not know of any threats posed by Cruz to the school.

But maths teacher Jim Gard told the Miami Herald that he believes the school had sent out an email warning teachers that Cruz should not be allowed on campus with a backpack.

He added: ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.""

Photos posted on Cruz's Instagram account showed him posing with guns and knives. Police have described the social media posts as “very, very disturbing"".

It also emerged that a YouTube user called 'Nikolas Cruz' had written chilling comments on videos just months ago.

One comment under a documentary about the 1966 Texas University massacre read ""I am going to what he did"" [sic].

Image: YouTube) YouTube)

Another YouTube user claims someone with the handle 'Nikolas Cruz' commented on one of his videos last year, writing: ""I want to be a professional school shooter.""

The FBI were alerted to that post in September and carried out an investigation, but it was unclear what, if anything, happened from there.

When Cruz was a freshman he was part of the US military-sponsored Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corp programme at the school.

In an interview with Reuters, Jillian Davis, 19, a recent graduate who was in the programme with Cruz, recalled his ""strange talking sometimes about knives and guns"", but said ""no one ever took him seriously"".

Chad Williams, 18, described Cruz as ""kind of an outcast"" who was ""crazy about guns"" and was known for unruly behavior at school, including a penchant for pulling false fire alarms.

Trevor Hart, who had been in a Spanish class with Cruz, told the Orlando Sentinel that the 19-year-old seemed ""a little off"" and had talked about shooting lizards, squirrels and frogs.

Former schoolmate Alex Azar told CBS Miami: ""He always seemed like the unstable type, the type who would do this sort of thing. He was always in the office. He was always in trouble, very unstable. He had that look to him, kind of sinister.""

Former neighbour Shelby Speno told how police were called to Cruz's home numerous times and he had been seen shooting at a fellow neighbour's chickens.

Another former neighbour, Janine Kartiganer, added: “He wore a hoodie and always had his head down. He looked depressed.”

Wednesday's shooting ranked as the ninth-deadliest mass shooting in modern US history and the second-deadliest act of gun violence ever on a US public school campus, behind the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.

In that incident, deranged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children aged six and seven and six adult staff members after killing his mum Nancy at their home in the town.

Lanza shot and killed himself as emergency services arrived at the scene.

The number of school shootings in the US has steadily increased in recent years, and the Parkland shooting is just the latest chapter in the longtime debate over preventative measures, including gun control.

There were fresh calls for the US government to do more to prevent similar tragedies.

US President Donald Trump didn't mention any potential preventative measures in his response to the attack.

He appeared to suggest that those who were aware of the warning signs didn't do enough to alert authorities beforehand.

He wrote on Twitter: ""So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!""

Image: Photodisc) Photodisc)

In earlier tweets, he wrote: ""My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.

""Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.""

Reports from the US indicated that local police had dealt with Cruz on several occasions, he had been kicked out of school and staff were warned about him, and the FBI had investigated the ""professional school shooter"" comment that appeared to be posted by him on YouTube.

As well, CNN reported that Cruz was able to purchase an assault rifle after passing a background check.

Joe Melita, former head of the Professional Standards & Special Investigative Unit at Broward County Public Schools, told Action News Jax that that several district security officials were aware of Cruz

He added: “They were familiar with who the young man was.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: ""I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.""

Meanwhile there have been 18 school shootings in the US already this year, an average of one every 2.5 days. At this time last year there had been seven, US media reported.

According to Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings since January 1, or one every 1.5 days.

Wednesday's school shooting occurred about 20 months after mass killer Omar Mateen, 29, murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, called Pulse, in Orlando Florida. His rampage ended when he was shot dead by police.

The June 2016 massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history until gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last October.

Paddock shot and killed himself before police stormed the Mandalay Bay hotel room he had used into a sniper's perch.","['https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article24108455.ece/BINARY/0_1Desktop-email-selection.jpg', 'https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12029570.ece/ALTERNATES/s1168v/scene.jpg', 'https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12029292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Shooting-At-High-School-In-Parkland-Florida-Injures-Multiple-People.jpg', 'https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/2LQP0BqM/poster.jpg', 'https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article24108458.ece/BINARY/0_1Mobile-email-selection.jpg', 'https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/MACQWPLc/poster.jpg', 'https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12030856.ece/ALTERNATES/s1168v/instagramnew.jpg']",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12029292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Shooting-At-High-School-In-Parkland-Florida-Injures-Multiple-People.jpg,[],"['Chris Kitching', 'Lucy Clarke-Billings', 'Steve Robson', 'Image', 'Liveleak', 'Twitter', 'Joshcohenradio', 'Wplg', 'Nikolas_Cruz Instagram', 'Broward County Sheriff']",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/there-blood-everywhere-terrified-students-12029466,"Inside the Snapchat bloodbath: 60 minutes of terror which left 17 dead, bodies in classrooms and kids 'full of blood'",[],1518723480.0,http://www.mirror.co.uk,
285,http://actionnews3.com/legendary-actor-kirk-douglas-dead-age-100/,"News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old.

Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.”

Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style.

As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs.

Kushner, who is President Trump’s son-in-law, will no longer be able to access top-secret intelligence, Politico confirmed, noting three sources close to the situation.

Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level.

According to Politico, the memo he was sent was not personally signed by chief of staff John Kelly.

White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trump‘s job performance within the administration, according to a recent report by CNN.

Sources revealed to the news network that Kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president.

Kelly has reportedly explained to others privately that the first daughter is “playing government,” while branding her child tax credit as “a pet project.”

The shocking report comes after Trump’s trip to the closing Olympic ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea last week, which has raised concerns among several in the White House, including Kelly.

“This isn’t like going to Italy. The stakes are far higher and more complex,” a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.

Kelly reportedly expressed his worries behind closed doors about the first daughter’s utter lack of experience, however, the White House assured this past Monday that he was in support of her visit.

290,https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/michelle-obama-just-received-life-shattering-news-from-the-doctor/,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.

Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.

Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.

Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:

Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?

Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”

Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.

“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”

As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.

“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.

Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.

The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.

Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:

So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.

Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.

The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-34-550x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-28.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-30.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-37-550x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-36-550x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-31-550x319.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-32-550x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-27.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-35-550x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-33-550x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-29.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220im_/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-29.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144220/https://www.nyfoxnews.co/michelle-obama-just-received-life-shattering-news-from-the-doctor/,Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The Doctor,[],1520203553.0,https://web.archive.org,

Commissioner of Food and Drugs - Food and Drug Administration ( May 2017 - April 2019 )





Español

The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.

As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.

As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.

These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.

Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2

There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.

While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.

So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?

We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.

However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.

Working to determine the root causes

Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.

What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.

The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.

Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season

While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next season’s flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this year’s influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this year’s flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.

In the meantime, this flu season isn’t over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctor’s offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. It’s also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.

The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this season’s flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trump’s candidacy.

Recognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace.

But, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trump’s apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father won’t get the credit. “Remember who decides this stuff,” he tweeted. “... The globalist elite would never give him that win.”

It’s not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine.

Trump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With “rocket man” quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war.

After the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined.

“I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,"" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.""

If that meeting and Friday’s summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award.

“We’re not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,” Graham said on Friday on Fox & Friends.

Laura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday.

“When will we see the headline: “Trump Ends the Korean War”? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Ingraham said.

If Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissinger’s acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because “peace has not been really restored in South Vietnam.”

“When the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize,” he said.

Other controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time.

Former President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.""

The first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to depopulate Africa.

There are currently 329 candidates for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, according to the organization’s website. The winners will be announced on December 10.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/03/02/image-00.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/24/01-pirates-caribbean-dead-mans-chest-disney.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/17/image-00.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/12/20171127-two.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/02/22/billionaires-intro.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/11/23/1123malcolmturnbulldonaldtrump.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/10/image-00.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/04/28/image-952173714.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/13/image-01.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/02/28/gettyimages-621063276-donald-trump-peace.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/11/image-00.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/02/20/abraham-lincoln.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/04/27/nobel.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/04/28/image-952173714_0.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/04/28/image-952173714.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180429022539/http://www.newsweek.com/president-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-nobel-peace-prize-north-korea-south-korea-905146,Could Trump Win The Nobel Peace Prize?

(Zero Hedge) A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.

This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.

The new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The man was not identified by authorities.

Neighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. He was not brandishing his weapon by any account, and open carrying is legal in the area, so he was abiding by the law. Other residents also complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe.”

“He was roaming the hallways with a .25 caliber automatic,” said Tony Montana, a man who lives in the same apartment complex as the gun owner and a person without any reasonable gun knowledge. Handguns are semi-automatic…

Cyrus wrote the caption next to a publicity photo of Trump; Cyrus’ Instagram burn has gained 239,000 likes since it was posted Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of Trump’s delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.

Cyrus’ Instagram then took aim at self-proclaimed “most hated woman in the world” Rebecca Francis, a woman who uses her social media to showcase her hunting prowess, and the hunter’s allegiance to Trump.

Cyrus isn’t the only artist to lament a possible future with Trump as commander in chief: Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Flea recently told Rolling Stone, “I can’t take Donald Trump or anything he says seriously. I just think that he’s a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I don’t think he wants to be president, and I don’t think he has a chance to be the president. He’s just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob.

298,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/12/ice-removal-key-goal-democrats-in-2020-election.html,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe.

In protesting the Trump administration’s policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.

“This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted.

In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.

“ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon tweeted. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.”

Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.

“These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,” Homan said Thursday on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”

But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.

“ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,” Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. “But let’s not abuse the power.”

Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.

“Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,” Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. “It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.”

He added: “She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.”

Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- “should be asked the same question.”

PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS ‘UNJUST AND CRUEL’

The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” The writer accused the agency of being part of an “unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state” and called it “an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”

“Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it’s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,” McElwee wrote.

Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as ""unjust and cruel.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff’s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.

SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR ‘RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA’

Sessions called California’s ""open borders"" policies a “radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.”

“It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,” he said. “How can this be a sound policy?”","['https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/12/931/524/694940094001_5749708874001_5749685765001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/08/694940094001_5747590283001_5747581490001-vs.jpg', 'http://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-news-first.svg', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/12/348/196/Army-Vaccination.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/03/340/340/IMG_4586.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/4b684694-26a6-4ccc-84b1-e424599aa372/2c4404ce-15fd-487f-9a87-41f812d041ec/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/12/348/196/Kevin-McCarthy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/04/348/196/Biden-CC.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/12/694940094001_5749708874001_5749685765001-vs.jpg', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/kamala-harris.jpg?ve=1&tl=1']",http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/12/694940094001_5749708874001_5749685765001-vs.jpg,[],"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com.']",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ice-removal-key-goal-of-democrats-in-2020-election,ICE removal key goal of Democrats in 2020 election,[],1520784000.0,http://www.foxnews.com,
299,patrioticviralnews.com/articles/international-arrest-warrant-issued-for-george-soros/,"George Soros—the Billionaire investment banker who has admitted to manipulating the financial markets in Asia, the UK, Greece, and Russia has finally gone too far.

You see Mr. Soros has become persona non grata across the globe for his role in destabilizing country’s economy’s and financial markets. He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others.

George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S.

He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.

Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the ‘90’s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.

Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia’s currency and the resulting financial meltdown.

Now, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change. We’ll have to see.

Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.

Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.

Jones wrote:

“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”

Judge Perry added:

“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”

British film producer and the co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan released statements on Ronan’s death on Monday.

Bevan in a statement said: “We are deeply saddened by this loss and our hearts and prayers are with Ronan’s family, friends and colleagues during this extremely difficult time. She was 23.”

“Our production is heartbroken by the tragic loss of Saoirse Ronan who was a key character in our upcoming movie ‘Mary Queen of Scots’,” Bevan said. “Ronan’s work on ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and dozens of other movies and shows will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations. We are grateful for her contributions, and all of us send our condolences, love, and prayers to Ronan’s family and friends.”

According to Beausejour Coroner Bradley Cyril, Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall. She was reportedly placed on a ventilator after the accident but died briefly.

The Golden Globe Award winner fell more than 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor, suffering a serious head injury that required her to be transported to a nearby hospital by an ambulance. Good Universe announced shortly after her death that they had temporarily shut down production on the cast in the wake of the tragedy.

Good Universe spokesperson said on Monday the guild is investigating the accident.

“We are saddened to report that Charlize Theron, our irreplaceable star for ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and numerous other television shows and films, suffered serious injuries from a tragic accident on set,” the Production said in a statement on Monday. “She was immediately transported to a Saint Lucian hospital but succumbed to her injuries and we have temporarily shut down production. The safety of our members is paramount. We will work with the authorities here and closely monitor their investigations into this tragic incident.”

In addition, the Saint Lucian office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed to Variety this morning that they have launched their own investigation into the incident.

Saoirse Úna Ronan came to international prominence in 2007 after co-starring as Briony Tallis in the film Atonement with James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, for which she received nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award, making her one of the youngest actresses to receive an Oscar nomination.

Her film breakthrough was followed by her starring role in Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones for which she was awarded a Critics’ Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and a second BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress. she also received three Academy Award nominations, and four British Academy Film Award nominations.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-121-145x95.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-6-145x95.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-610x400.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-119-145x95.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/stlu.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-122-145x95.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-120-145x95.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-10-145x95.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-117-145x95.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-118-145x95.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-150x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-8-145x95.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-124-145x95.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804im_/http://stluciantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D-150x150.jpg,[],['The Editor'],https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213804/http://stluciantimes.com/breaking-irish-superstar-saoirse-ronan-dies-after-on-set-accident-in-st-lucia/,BREAKING: Irish superstar Saoirse Ronan dies after on-set accident in St. Lucia,[],,https://web.archive.org,

Roof, the first person to be convicted of a federal hate crime and sentenced to the death penalty, was removed from custody in Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday and transferred to Terre Haute, prison records show.

Terre Haute, a medium-security prison where inmates are put to death by lethal injection, currently houses 1,338 inmates.

In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war.

He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10.

Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

As of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 — drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.

Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his ""unique"" security arrangements.

After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it.

Like his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon.

Legal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment"" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected.","['https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/p_debunk_capital_140227.jpg', 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG', 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG']","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG",[],['Avalon Zoppo'],https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-moved-death-row-terre-haute-federal-n749671,Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison,[],1492879740.0,https://www.nbcnews.com,

304,thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid,"Vice President Biden on Monday raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.

“I am going to run in 2020,” Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future. “What the hell man, anyway.”

Asked if he was kidding about running, the 74-year-old paused before saying he is “not committing not to run.”

“I am not committed to anything,” he added. “I learned a long time ago, fate has a strange way of intervening.”

It would be surprising if Biden decided to continue his decadeslong political career, which many assumed would end once President Obama and he leave the White House next month.

Biden will be 78 in 2020 and would by far be the oldest person ever to win a major-party presidential nomination if he became the Democrats’ standard-bearer.

After months of toying with a presidential run this cycle, Biden announced last October that he would not mount a bid. He said he ran out of time “necessary to mount a winning campaign” while mourning the loss of his son, Beau, to cancer.

Biden spoke publicly before the election about his post-White House plans, which include working on his cancer moonshot initiative, a possible policy project with a major university and writing a book.

The vice president was at the Capitol on Monday afternoon to preside over the Senate as it held a vote on legislation funding the cancer initiative, a portion of which the chamber named after Beau.

He would have to put that work aside if he decided to launch a presidential bid in four years.

The vice president has long had his eye on the Oval Office. He ran for president in 1988 and again in 2008, losing both times in his party’s primary.

305,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/09/trump-presidents-carter-bush-clinton-238125,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.

During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.

The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.

In Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.

“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”

As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.

Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.

At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.

And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.

George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”

As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.

Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.

Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”

George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.

Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.

“We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.”

Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.

“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”

While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.

“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.

For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.

Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.

“What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.”

All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.

But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was “encouraged” by their first post-election meeting.

Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS’ John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.

“He was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,” Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was “inappropriate.”

Historically speaking, Trump’s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors’ had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. “That one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,” she said

And Trump hasn’t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a “bad (or sick) guy!” as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush “not nice” during the campaign, said the Bush administration “lied” about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton “the WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.”

George H.W. Bush and Carter weren’t excluded from Trump’s slights. “Enough is Enough- No More Bushses!” Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.

Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.

And Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and — while revealing that he voted for Sanders — Carter said the ""downturn"" of human rights ""preceded 2016.""

“President Carter, I think he hopes that he won’t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,” Hochman said. “Actually, I’m sure he would.”

Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He’s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.

“They may have personal opinions, but they’re not going to express them,” Skinner said. “Both 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they’ve been both very cautious about what they say.”

McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. “I wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,” he said.

Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today’s events in Washington.

“I think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,” he said.","['data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/76973dd/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa9%2F3f%2Fa736e04646d0a343e231126e5532%2F170508-george-w-bush-ap-17059623005115.jpg', 'https://static.politico.com/a9/3f/a736e04646d0a343e231126e5532/170508-george-w-bush-ap-17059623005115.jpg']",https://static.politico.com/a9/3f/a736e04646d0a343e231126e5532/170508-george-w-bush-ap-17059623005115.jpg,[],"['Martin Matishak', 'Austin Wright', 'Nolan D.

307,http://time.com/5161034/florida-school-shooting-survivor/,"David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.

And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor—Hogg doesn’t know his name but calls him an angel—knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg—who’s an editor at the school’s TV station—found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.

The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.

“While I was in there, I thought, ‘What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?’” Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. “And the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that’s all I could think: Get other people’s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that’s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.”

In the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. It’s being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And it’s becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.

“When do we say, that’s not acceptable, something has to change?” asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.

Hogg’s sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.

Will Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunman’s wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that haven’t been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasn’t real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacher’s orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.

“It was hot in there. We were packed in tight,” he told TIME. “Some students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.” Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.

“My husband is ex-military, so it’s not like we’re anti-gun. But an AR-15?” Kristi Gilroy said. “You tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?” Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children she’d taught when they were younger.

The usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. “Now, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,” Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. “Our students are asking for that.”

President Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.

“To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,” Trump said. “We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that she’d been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. “Having to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,” she said, her eyes full of tears.

To some, however, words of comfort won’t be enough. “When do we actually stand up? I think it’s the time that we all stand up,” Hogg demanded. “If you don’t call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, it’s going to be your child that’s next. And that’s horrifying.”

Meanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that it’s okay to go back to school, that they’re safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.

308,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/16/ohio-student-suspended-for-staying-in-class-during-walkouts.html,"An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall.

Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, said he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate consuming the country. If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before.

Jacob had met with the school’s principal on Tuesday, a day before the rally, for about an hour to find out what exactly the walkout was supporting. But he said the principal reportedly told him it was for the “students to express themselves.”

This left Jacob wondering if it was a memorial for the lives lost or a show of support for gun control.

He decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door.

When they returned, he was slapped with a suspension.

Jacob’s father, Scott Shoemaker, said his son was just trying to stay neutral – and did nothing wrong.

“Politics [doesn’t] belong in the school,” he said. “Students shouldn’t be pressured into taking a side.”

The story went viral after Jacob sent a photo of his out-of-school suspension citation to one of his friends, who posted it on social media.

The school, as well as the Shoemakers, have received death threats and hate messages.

Scott Shoemaker said his son was just trying to be introspective – and he wasn’t acting out.

“He didn’t do anything to deserve this,” he said. “He didn’t ask for this.”

President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to journalist Chris Menahan.“They said back in July only 55 out of one million migrants had got jobs with any major firms and 50 of those jobs were working at the post office,” he reported. “Two-thirds or more of these migrants are illiterate in their own languages.”“They came because Merkel promised them free money if they can just make it into the country.”What in tarnation would be a good reason for any country to accept illiterate people who don’t work? There is literally no benefit to the host country to admit people like that. I know it sounds mean to say this, but they don’t offer anything to the country other than leeching the system of funds and it’s a complete downgrade to the population. If you let too many low illiterate people into the country, then they have kids who could be illiterate, then over time, it would only decrease the overall intelligence of the country and civilization in America would suffer. We need hard working and intelligent people who bring promise and productivity to further the advancement of Americans and mankind. That sounds like quite a stretch but think of the impact of accepting one million people who mostly can’t read or don’t work.Now the government has to pay for them.Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That’s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all. That is literally a $0.00 return on investment. Not that people are a business, but that’s really bad business. And as you can see, Germany has turned into a cesspool from all the migrants flooding the gates and ruining their nation.Prepare for a massive backlash from liberals, democrats, and activists. There’s sure to be protests regarding Trump’s potential immigration policy.FOLLOW us on Facebook at Freedom Daily!","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://www.americatb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-welfare-riots-main-1200x630-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/217465c479487a26550c6fe4adac1ff4?s=80&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://www.americatb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-welfare-riots-main-1200x630.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8277f7285c5c1e5148e5bfdc18db894a?s=80&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://www.americatb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/enVolve-POLL-Death-Penalty-4-Men-Rape-9-Girl1-800x445-800x4001-1-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://www.americatb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lexi3redo-678x356-80x60.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219im_/http://www.americatb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-welfare-riots-main-1200x630.jpg,[],"['Hal Lemoyne', 'Phil Hansen', 'Virginia Jewell', 'John Zagar']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180404213219/http://www.americatb.com/2018/03/29/breaking-trump-just-ended-welfare-for-one-huge-group-for-5-years-let-the-riots-erupt/,BREAKING: Trump Just Ended Welfare For One HUGE Group For 5 Years! – Let The Riots ERUPT!,[],1522252800.0,https://web.archive.org,

A few days ago, a student at Harvard leaked the contents of Malia Obama’s speech final. The topic? A World Without Whites. And now it may get Malia Obama suspended.

“White people are so 1960’s. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,” a recording of Obama’s speech shared on Snapchat said. “Imagine a world without white people.” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.

A post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.

“This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. “Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will “forfeit her grade for the exam” which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.

The dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “expulsion,” but we’re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180414054648im_/http://onlypolitics.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/malia-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180414054648im_/http://onlypolitics.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180414054648im_/http://onlypolitics.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/icon.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180414054648im_/http://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?4038444&101']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180414054648im_/http://onlypolitics.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/icon.png,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180414054648/http://onlypolitics.info/breaking-malia-obama-suspended-after-racist-anti-white-attack-goes-viral/,BREAKING: Malia Obama SUSPENDED After Racist Anti-White Attack Goes Viral,[],,https://web.archive.org,

Aldrin, the second man on the moon, and four others gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions.

He, Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper all took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio.

Aldrin, 88, claimed he was a spaceship on his way to the moon, adding: ""There was something out there that was close enough to be observed... sort of L-shaped.""

The tests, reportedly more reliable than standard lie detector tests, showed he was telling the truth, the Daily Star reported.

Apollo 15 pilot Worden, 85, and Apollo 14's Mitchel also claimed to have seen UFOs while Cooper says he actually tried to chase a cluster of objects.

Buzz Aldrin gives a confused look as Donald Trump talks about space security

Tests analysing their voice patterns suggested they were also telling the truth about their strange encounters.

Aldrin answered questions about his alleged encounter with alien life on a Reddit Q&A with fans last week.

In one post he said: ""On Apollo 11 in route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us.

""There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world.

""It was either the rocket we had separated from or the four panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket.

""It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said.

""There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space.

""It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.""

On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the earth’s moon.

Upon landing, he is famously quoted as saying: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""

Buzz was on the same mission, Apollo 11, as Neil Armstrong and soon followed in his footsteps - making him the second man on the moon.

In total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds.

Pete Conrad was a moon walker on the Apollo 12 mission, which launched on November 14, 1969. He was partnered by Alan Bean.

319,https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813/https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.

A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.

The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.

When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”

The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”

K.S. replied, “Correct.”

The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”

K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”

Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”

Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”

K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.

As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.

Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dream.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-2-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sent-headerad-728x90-01.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/print-button-gray.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/http://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/images-300x168.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sent_logoWEB-02.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sent_logoWEB3-03.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_37700338-218x150.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shutterstock_299623145-218x150.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813im_/https://sentinelksmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dream.jpg,[],['Jack Cashill'],https://web.archive.org/web/20180514074813/https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/,Breaking: Greitens Accuser Admits Photo Session May Have Been A “Dream”,[],1523249832.0,https://web.archive.org,
320,http://sciencevibe.com/2018/04/11/dying-78-year-old-cia-agent-admits-to-killing-marilyn-monroe/,"A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.

In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.

Hodges says he has no regrets.

He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.

Hodges had worked for the CIA.

Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.

He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.

Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.

He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.

Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.

“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”

Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.

The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.

The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.

This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage?

321,https://boingboing.net/2018/04/09/fox-news-accidentally-puts-up.html,"UPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.

During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic ""clear recovery,"" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.

When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.

Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.

Kurtz quickly said, ""This is not the graphic we're looking for – hold off. Take that down please!""

322,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/donald-trump-inauguration-ceremony-artists-performing-elton-john-legend-celine-dion-a7492991.html,"With only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate.

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.

It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day.

So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day.

Here is who has declined so far:

Elton John

This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.""

That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.""

John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.

""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.""

Andrea Bocelli

In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.

Ice T

An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.

But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.

He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.""

Celine Dion

According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.

Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.

John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: ""Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.

""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.""

Adam Lambert

Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.

""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""

The Dixie Chicks

Opposition to the Iraq War derailed the career of Texan threesome Dixie Chicks (Getty)

Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said.

""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.""","['https://www.independent.co.uk/img/comments/spinner_on_black.gif', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/10/14/12/John-Legend.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/img/comments/spinner_on_white.gif', 'https://www.independent.co.uk/img/third-party/Amazon_Music.png', 'https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/UJ91PLm1/poster.jpg?width=720']",https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/10/14/12/John-Legend.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,[],[],https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/donald-trump-inauguration-ceremony-artists-performing-elton-john-legend-celine-dion-a7492991.html,"Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who won't perform at ceremony include Elton John, Celine Dion and John Legend",[],1482520830.0,https://www.independent.co.uk,
323,https://news.antiwar.com/2018/04/09/red-crescent-says-no-evidence-of-chemical-attack-in-syrias-douma/,"Update:

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.

—

The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.

The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.

(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)

Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.

The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack.","['https://dgxhtav2e25a8.cloudfront.net/highlights.jpg', 'https://d3hx7dpmkgxle9.cloudfront.net/ScottHortonShow3a.gif', 'https://dgxhtav2e25a8.cloudfront.net/breaking.jpg', 'https://dgxhtav2e25a8.cloudfront.net/antiwar_logo.gif', 'https://dgxhtav2e25a8.cloudfront.net/bourne04bt.gif', 'https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/87969456_b88f776fba_o.png', 'https://dgxhtav2e25a8.cloudfront.net/discuss2.gif', 'https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/377.jpg']",https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/377.jpg,[],"['View All Posts Jason Ditz', 'Author', 'Jason Ditz Is Senior Editor Of Antiwar.Com.']",https://news.antiwar.com/2018/04/09/red-crescent-says-no-evidence-of-chemical-attack-in-syrias-douma/,THIS ARTICLE RETRACTED: Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria’s Douma,[],1523203200.0,https://news.antiwar.com,

According to Al-Jarida, Obama has no intention to step away from the spotlight, much to the dismay of other world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.

Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.

Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.”

Townhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility.

Last year after his speech at West Point, some pointed out that he sounded an awful lot like he was campaigning for the role.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180413154033im_/http://usanews24h.tk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Special-Report-Anchors-3-1-678x381-2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180413154033im_/http://usanews24h.tk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot_1-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180413154033im_/http://usanews24h.tk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/newsEngin.21704343_berman-donnally-80x60.jpg']",,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180413154033/http://usanews24h.tk/index.php/2018/04/12/obama-announces-bid-to-become-un-secretary-general/,Obama Announces Bid To Become UN Secretary General – Usa News,[],1523462400.0,https://web.archive.org,

326,https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959/http://yournewswire.com:80/clinton-email-we-must-destroy-syria-for-israel/,"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.

The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.

Newobserveronline.com reports:

The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.

Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.

The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.

“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.

Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.

She specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.

If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.

Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.

Iran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.

An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.

If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.

It is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.

This would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”

The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.

Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.

Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.

Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:

In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.

With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.

The email proves—as if any more proof was needed—that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to “protect” Israel.

It is also a sobering thought to consider that the “refugee” crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria.

In addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq—all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the “rebels” and stoking the fires of war in Syria.

The real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton—whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people—could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all.

Clinton’s public assertion that, if elected president, she would “take the relationship with Israel to the next level,” would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=/7lYk1a4eFf26C', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Syria-fight-Syria-for-Israel-790x350.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/devastated-GAZA-UN-30-years-rebuild-70x53.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/president-sisi-with-his-generals-at-a-military-parade.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/isis-passport-70x53.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lions-gate-idf-border-police-east-jerusalem--70x53.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/1511651_10152594103870715_1942518842_o.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Theresa-May-006.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Syria-fight-Syria-for-Israel.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/clinton-email-syria-israel.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Syria-fight-Syria-for-Israel.jpg,[],"['Avner Eliyahu Romm', 'Marv Sammons', 'Javo Santo', 'Muhammad Sohail Iftikhar', 'Alan Folsom', 'Gail Bergstrom', 'Sm Farid Uddin Akhter', 'Obadiah Zuen']",https://web.archive.org/web/20160620220959/http://yournewswire.com/clinton-email-we-must-destroy-syria-for-israel/,Clinton Email: We Must Destroy Syria For Israel,[],1466294385.0,https://web.archive.org,

The Clinton Foundation is once again trying to distance itself from a scandal surrounding something they’re involved in. This time, the warehouse they use in the UK to store food and toiletries to make ready for shipping to Africa and Indonesia was raided by MI6.

The warehouse, which is leased by the Foundation and one other tenant, is owned by a man known for shady arms deals and exploiting cheap Asian labor for counterfeit goods. The Brits took down his office and storage space, finding 400 Million in US Dollars. Maleek Bin Shalakta has been on the UK terrorist watch list for some time.

The Foundation claims to only be renting the space. Chelsea Clinton’s assistant told LLOD correspondent Cynthia Luwhoe:

“Who owns the building is irrelevant. We rented through an agency.”

The agency in question is also owned by Bin Shalakta, as is the trucking company the Foundation uses in France, Germany and Latkavia. Commander Ian Humes says the coincidences are far too many to ignore:

“What interests us is that the cash is the same amount as the US payments to Iran for hostages. It was palletted and wrapped in US State Department palstic sheeting. We believe we may be looking at more than money laundering here. This may be a massive fraud perpetrated against Americans and the world.”

What we’re looking at here is yet another crime against America. Once MI6 is finished processing the scene they’ve vowed to work with the FBI to figure out if there’s a connection.

328,https://web.archive.org/web/20180424001608/http://nytimes-news.com/archbishop-desmond-tutu-dies-while-holidaying-in-texas/,"HOUSTON, TEXAS – Anti-apartheid and human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu has died in Texas at the age of 86.

His wife Leah Tutu told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago.

According to Leah Tutu, Desmond Tutu was rushed to hospital in the wee hours of Saturday morning where he passed on. The cause of his death is not immediately known.

In August 2016, Tutu’s daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe he was in the hospital for treatment of a recurring infection.

Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe may have described him as “evil”, but Archbishop Desmond Tutu remained a much-loved figure across the world – principally for his role in South Africa’s struggle against apartheid.

During the long years that Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu spoke out against the regime – and won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 for his efforts.

He was chosen by President Mandela to chair South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and investigate the crimes committed by all sides during the apartheid regime.

Before his demise, “the Arch” – as he was known – had remained irrepressible and influential both in his native South Africa and on the global political stage.

He was chairman of a group of former world leaders called The Elders, launched on Nelson Mandela’s 89th birthday in 2007 with the aim of tackling some of the world’s most pressing problems.

332,https://newstarget.com/2016-02-23-usda-approves-slaughterhouses-producing-horse-meat-for-human-consumption.html,"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption

You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.

Where do these horses come from?

While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.

Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.

Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:

Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.

How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.

The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.

This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PHnA3dCaqI4/VdPrZGg-MHI/AAAAAAAALtw/907msPmkj1c/s1600/ie-share-pinterest.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jj9bwNByuMU/WtEseQk6gkI/AAAAAAAAAM8/EIjIWTx21hUwC98viimsvbi0civc62EqwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/NEWSFEEDUSA.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3Nej6-Lwfk/VdPrZJsHYLI/AAAAAAAALts/A-8fIlSRVAk/s1600/ie-share-google-plus.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GCZgnTmPMBk/VdPrZ1MUYXI/AAAAAAAALt4/kDPp85Zxj3w/s1600/ie-share-twiiter.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t9GOLY75v-0/WrDIbpkd0-I/AAAAAAAAFaU/LqA6YVTh5rwiwNvVS_FJpe1fnz_1z--sgCK4BGAYYCw/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/queen-snubs-michelle1-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yhtupG4S4pY/VdPrZP56fII/AAAAAAAALto/tfRtn6o16JY/s1600/ie-share-facebook.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-23cKHQnn8dg/WtHLk7KHKdI/AAAAAAAABL8/r-pLNzmeLQ0nPkrwEBl_D71eQvsfc_Z6QCLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/1.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nLOD5b-4iSY/WtEsfERvAsI/AAAAAAAAANE/h2MyIEFeEnAAnUw6wJXb2X5R-IaHe0WsACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/NEWSFEEDUSA.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/-l6rOV5nFTQwe2LhpQuUSb_doMBZiHlNhTNtJAVUSHlmlncskxz5gHZclik-oeuEg7OOWqcXVrsXjH4D_z16Wj-w_WejsLSQfUNy8zX-lBRp4CWZBbF014kO9_yKMtNtlQciVzpAwcMTGPqWh-gewZ0_j1X8OtIIPcjgudoKdpxTd8fC=w72-h72-p-k-no-nu', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p_613EKeiXI/WtHMyjoEpFI/AAAAAAAABMY/0_h6sOGnQNEOTjOzkpqNJ2ZWS_r7Y9uCACLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/1.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiGoJeHK3v4/WtHIVsnm52I/AAAAAAAABLU/IxhNKUTVtgwcdFKHaxn_vBosdFbf7puyACLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/s640/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zdjCL-FBUkk/We6z15yHzsI/AAAAAAAABsA/_nOwzfTPkeo6BWVgWiVqcZwTyI6WvLDjwCLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/Capture-30.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930/http://www.newsfeedusa.us/2018/04/obamas-private-security-company-sets-up.html,OBAMA’S PRIVATE ‘SECURITY’ COMPANY SETS UP MASSIVE CAMPS OUTSIDE 3 MAJOR CITIES,[],,https://web.archive.org,

While the mainstream media continues to ignore Pelosi’s scandals, Breitbart reported on Thursday that “at least five men and one woman have complained about Pelosi making unwanted advances in the past, but it always got swept under the rug.”

According to the publication, two sources have confirmed that they were “incentivized” to transfer out of her office — one with a promotion and one with a lump sum cash payment of $15,000.

According to insiders, Pelosi “has determined that she has no choice but to step down, though she wholeheartedly denies the allegations.”

Three of Pelosi’s accusers, all male, are former interns and pages, while the others worked as a clerical aide and a member of the cleaning staff..

Pelosi has been attacking Roy Moore lately for his alleged consensual affair with a young woman, but was simply her covering up her own misdeeds with fake outrage.

It’s time for that old bat to retire anyway, but it’s good to see her go sooner rather than later. Now it’s time for a Republican to take her seat.",['https://web.archive.org/web/20180426092034im_/http://nrtonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Untitled-35-678x381.jpg'],,[],['George Swenson'],https://web.archive.org/web/20180426092034/http://nrtonline.info/breaking-nancy-pelosi-to-resign-after-new-revelations/,BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi To Resign After New Revelations – NRTOnline,[],,https://web.archive.org,

""Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!"" states the website Delta-Flying.info.

After we started our fact-check, the link was no longer in use and had been flagged as suspected phishing. It is not an official Delta website.

Such hoaxes that Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, have been giving away free tickets have circulated for years.

Don’t take the surveys — these are all scams.

Graham Cluley, a security analyst, has previously written about the repercussions of the Southwest scam in 2016:

""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam.""

Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo pointed to this page on Delta.com where legitimate offers from the airline are located.

The story that said Delta Airlines offers free airline tickets for people who take a short survey is a scam. We rate this story Pants on Fire.","['https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3/e4c499ea21bf3dc134a5fec8477707a9.jpg',

Marvin Schmidt, the now-former Saturday afternoon co-host of one of their programs, decided it would be fun to defend “comedian” Michelle Wolf’s disgusting attacks on the White House Press Secretary by further attacking her appearance far past her “smokey” eyes and alleged resemblance to The Handmaid’s Tale’s Aunt Lydia.

“Look at that face,” Schmidt said in a now-deleted tweet. “I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?”

In a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:

We are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman’s looks no matter what one’s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.

337,https://web.archive.org/web/20180430042800/https://yournewswire.com/smallville-star-sold-children-rothschilds-clintons/,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.

According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.

Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.

The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.

“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”

When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.

Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.

In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.

The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.

Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.

A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.

Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.

Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.

Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.

Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.

In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.

Frank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.

“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.

Of Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.

“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.

It is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.

In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.

Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:

“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”

“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”

Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.



The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:

“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”

Yes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?

You’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.

Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.

Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.

“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”

After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.

With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180501124531im_/http://www.patriotnetwork.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13-300x278.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180501124531im_/http://www.patriotnetwork.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/12-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180501124531im_/http://www.patriotnetwork.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180501124531im_/http://www.patriotnetwork.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/9-678x381.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180501124531im_/http://www.patriotnetwork.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13-300x278.png,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180501124531/http://www.patriotnetwork.one/2018/04/27/breaking-czech-republic-arms-citizens-you-can-now-shoot-terrorists-on-sight/,BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS – “YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT” – US PATRIOTS,[],1524758400.0,https://web.archive.org,
339,https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213/http://yournewswire.com/bill-gates-doctor-vaccinate/,"The physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle in the 1990s says the Microsoft founder and vaccine proponent “refused to vaccinate his own children” when they were young.

“I don’t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children,” the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle, adding “They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didn’t need any shots.“

The comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.

Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.

The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.

The elite do not vaccinate

In California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.

The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.

Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.

The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.

“Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism.“","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/scilian-mafia-war-islam-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UK-forces-ISIS-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HAARP-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/UK-elite-pedophile-ring-80x60.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=/7lYk1a4eFf26C', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cyberattack-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/antifa-terrorist-texas-church-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1352519464392.cached-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/130611051853_1WEB-HD-snowden-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bill-gates-non-vaccinate-children.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/John-McCain-Orlando-Obama-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-03-at-11.09.57-PM-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-03-at-10.48.50-PM-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bill-gates-non-vaccinate-children-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/harvard-vaccines-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12-george-p-bush.w1200.h630-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cats-6-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/democrats-voter-fraud-trump-investigation-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bill-gates-non-vaccinate-children-696x449.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/reporter-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/moscow-protest-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/obama-clinton-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Obama-aircraft-carriers-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CDC-doctor-326x245.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213im_/http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bill-gates-non-vaccinate-children.jpg,[],['Stephanie Christian'],https://web.archive.org/web/20180208043213/http://yournewswire.com/bill-gates-doctor-vaccinate/,Bill Gates’ Former Doctor Says Billionaire ‘Refused To Vaccinate His Children’,[],1518026285.0,https://web.archive.org,
340,http://www.mysterious-times.com/2018/04/30/bill-gates-outlines-2018-plan-to-depopulate-the-planet/,"Bill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that “by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.”

Make no mistake, when Gates talks about “making people healthier,” what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents.

The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them.

Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests.

The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny.

Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.”

Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women.

The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes.

Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world.

Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket:

“Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared.

Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations.

Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives?

None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.","['https://i1.wp.com/mysterious-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dsassa2121342.png?fit=1000%2C564&ssl=1', 'https://www.mysterious-times.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/penci-holder.png', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/823e2ef40c17f1326a56579c581918c0?s=100&d=mm&r=g', 'https://www.mysterious-times.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/logo.png']",https://i1.wp.com/mysterious-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dsassa2121342.png?fit=1000%2C564&ssl=1,[],['Mysterious Times'],https://mysterious-times.com/2018/04/30/bill-gates-outlines-2018-plan-to-depopulate-the-planet/,Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet,['https://www.youtube.com/embed/obRG-2jurz0?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent'],1525017600.0,http://www.mysterious-times.com,
341,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/daily-shows-michelle-wolf-lands-her-own-netflix-late-night-show-1083705,"Michelle Wolf has landed a show of her own.

After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf’s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.

The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda — unless, of course, it’s funny. “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix’s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: “We’re thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.”

The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (“I want equal pay! And a chardonnay”) to dating and other social issues.

Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.

By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central — and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network’s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.

Looking ahead, Wolf’s Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President’s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.

Wolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman.","['https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY', 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg', 'https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michellewolf-h_2018.jpg?w=1024']",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michellewolf-h_2018.jpg?w=1024,[],['Lacey Rose'],https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/daily-shows-michelle-wolf-lands-her-own-netflix-late-night-show-1083705/,‘The Daily Show’s’ Michelle Wolf Lands Her Own Netflix Late-Night Show (Exclusive),[],1518426000.0,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com,

The machine, the Big Blue Bernie Or Buster, is a modified Jeep CJ-7. The right rear shock, with a diameter of 40 inches and weighing 403 pounds, imploded Clinton’s head at approximately 14 miles per hour. The coroner said it would have been a solid minute of excruciating pain combined with a cognitive awareness that your head was about to be crushed like a grape.

The driver of the Monster machine said when he realized he was going to lose it he headed straight for where he knew Clinton was sitting:

“I had a decision to make. I could either steer into random people or try to minimize the damage by localizing it to the woman who is guilty of 218 murders, 40 DACA violations, Benghazi and the Russia scandal, not to mention Monica Lewinski. I did what i thought was tight. I’d do it again.”

The local police are calling the incident a “tragic and yet unavoidable accident.” They went on to applaud driver Greg Page for his quick actions that saved the lives of regular people.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180503012437im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rated-S.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180503012437im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bn-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180503012437im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-dwu-cover-1-1.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180503012437im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bn.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180503012437im_/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=125&r=g&d=monsterid']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180503012437im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bn.jpg,[],"['About Flagg Eagleton', 'Flagg Eagleton Is The Son Of An American Potato Farmer', 'A Patriot.

NBC News reports:

The two black men whose arrest at a Philadelphia Starbucks last month set off a wave of protests against the coffee giant for discrimination have reached a settlement with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday.

They will each be paid $1.

In addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.

Robinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners.

Good for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment.

In his rally in Pensylvania this past Saturday night President Trump made an interesting comment about First Lady Melania Trump.

The president mentioned the very first woman in the context of her role within his administration’s work in combating the opioid catastrophe and discussing “blue ribbon” study committees. To which he added that she’s a great first lady but her life isn’t simple.

It was a nice touch that the president mentioned the very first Lady since there’s been so much scrutiny in their union lately. Especially since the porn star Stormy Daniel is obviously trying to take attention off Donald and Melania’s strong marriage by placing it on her herself along with her sick affair asserts she has since recanted, but nevertheless won’t quit speaking about.

Daniels is making Melania look bad and the first woman is getting revenge by never giving into her attention-seeking ways with any reaction or attack, which the pornography celebrity probably wants considering she’s probably doing all of this for monetary gain and a wonderful book deal.

After all, it has to be hard being a washed-up porn star that will never be as well respected, well known, well liked and rich since Melania is.

Melania is keeping her class and elegance before the world in a very rough time. While at precisely the same time also showing she’s human and relatable by recognizing lifestyle is “not so simple.”

That’s a fact and leaves her relatable to us ordinary folk, it is not weakness, so it may very well be her greatest strength and the reason a lot people adore and respect her. Not sure you’ll be able to find 1 person who admires and would like to become Stormy Daniels.

Stormy, go crawl back into the cave you came out, no one here is interested in the accusations you are making which allegedly happened over a decade ago.

Via CBS News:

“It had been over a decade back from 2006 that, according to a Wall Street Journal expose published last week, porn celebrity Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, stated she’d slept with billionaire “Apprentice” host Donald Trump.

But outlets were chasing the story seemingly long before that.

InTouch magazine Wednesday released a seven-year-old interview with Clifford, in which she states she’d recurring sexual experiences with Mr. Trump after meeting him in July 2006.

“Whether you are a lover of his or not, which I never really was, you gotta admit he is pretty fascinating,” Clifford said in the 2011 interview that the magazine published Wednesday. “We had really great banter. He told me that I was a person to be reckoned with, smart and beautiful just like his daughter.”

It’s unclear with the publication didn’t operate with the interview at the time.

Jacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of Slate, wrote an article in his book before this week also saying he spoke with Clifford about the alleged tryst at the moment, and between August and October 2016, before the election, the porn star was prepared to take her story people.

An old acquaintance of his in California was near a girl from the adult-film business who claimed to have had an affair with Donald Trump. I reached my friend’s buddy, who placed me in touch with the celebrity, who’s called Stormy Daniels.

Daniels…did really have a narrative about Trump, which she related to me in a series of phone conversations and text exchanges that took place between August and October of 2016.”

Three of Clifford’s friends told Weisberg that they were conscious of the alleged affair at that time. Weisberg also published the screenshot of an unsigned document Clifford allegedly sent to him 2016.

Clifford was worried Mr. Trump would not cover, and she wished to be reimbursed somehow if she talked out instead, Weisberg wrote. Then, Weisberg said she stopped responding to his efforts at communication. He never published anything regarding the claims before the election.

“Given what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn’t believe an extramarital affair could be a highly significant story,” Weisberg wrote.

More specifically, she said her attorney Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills–based lawyer who specializes in claims against celebrities, had exercised the conditions with Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen.”

Slate wasn’t the only book pursuing the story.

A Fox News reporter, according to a CNN report, was also pursuing the story about the alleged event. Fox News writer Diana Falzone in October 2016 allegedly filed a story that included an on-the-record announcement from Clifford’s supervisor at the time confirming the alleged event, also Falzone had viewed emails talking a settlement. However, Fox News shelved the narrative, according to the CNN report.

Clifford a week denied the affair asserts in a statement provided to CBS News.

“To whom it may concern, I recently became aware that certain news outlets have been alleging that I had a sexual or romantic affair with Donald Trump guy, many, many years ago. I am stating with complete consent that this is totally false.”

The buzz about “Stormy Daniels” — she was trending on Twitter Friday — has seemingly died down as fast as it came. In the very first White House press briefing since the Wall Street Journal report, not one reporter asked about the narrative.”

Monday, May 07, 2018

A California Democrat was recently given a platform by USA Today to publish a shocking editorial that calls for nationwide confiscation of all “military-style semiautomatic assault weapons” from law-abiding citizens.

Representative Eric Swalwell from California’s 15th District wrote that all so-called “assault” weapons need to be banned, and that a federal gun buy-back program needs to be instituted in order to effectively collect them all from the citizenry.

Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their “assault” weapons be criminally prosecuted – including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry.

Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new “assault” weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary.

“Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed,” Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. “This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come.”

“Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.”

Democrats like Rep. Swalwell are enemies of the Constitution, and enemies of We the People

349,https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/europe/queen-last-corgi-dead-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.

Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain's longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog's death, telling CNN it was a private matter.

The Queen's fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.

Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign.

While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

351,https://web.archive.org/web/20180514221132/https://www.thebreakingdawn.site/it-begins-california-appoints-first-illegal-alien-to-state-office-trump-has-better-plan/,"Illegal aliens residing in the state of California in defiance of federal immigration laws would now be able to serve on all state and local boards and commissions under a proposal introduced before the California state Senate. Now the state of California has appointed its first “unprotected” illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.

The committee’s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful — the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or “Cal-SOAP,” for short — but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to college

Mateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.

Mateo said via Fox News – “While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.”

Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’

Senate Bill 174 made Mateo’s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.

“California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill’s author said in a statement. “Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can’t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.”

It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De León’s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo’s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.

Mateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting – In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w/ my same background did. I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value. I hope to do the same w/ @StudentAidCommission. #undocumentedunafraid.

Thank you Sen. @ kdeleon for appointing me to the CalSOAP Advisory Committee. I look forward to working w/ the rest of the committee & the Student Aid Commission in such important task – increase the accessibility of postsecondary education opportunities for low-income students.

Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty. In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish –

“Everything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.”

If she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.

It is important to note that while Mateo is the first “unprotected” illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.

De León and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.

Many were also quick to point out Mateo’s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions – “As someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.”

Citing EdSource data, de Leon’s office said an estimated 72,300 undocumented students are enrolled in California’s public colleges and universities.

352,http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/04/flash-24-daily/no-sandra-bullock-didnt-disparage-hillary-clinton/,"A fake news article said actress Sandra Bullock praised President Donald Trump while telling Hillary Clinton she could leave the United States if she isn’t happy with how things are going.

""Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again, you are one jealous woman who is nothing to compare with Trump, I hope he will arrest you soon,’"" said a Dec. 25 headline on Flash 24 Daily.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October.

While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didn’t include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name.

The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her ""new film,"" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.

At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.

""I don’t agree with that at all,"" Bullock said. ""That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.""

The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl.

""I would like my rights represented and those of my son — very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,"" she says. ""When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.""

We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton ""if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again."" We rate this headline Pants on Fire.","['https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3/e4c499ea21bf3dc134a5fec8477707a9.jpg',

After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, things haven’t gone quite as expected since the inception of Giuliani. He’s caused the president more harm than good, notably when he contradicted the president’s story regarding the hush payment sent to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election.

Now, it appears that instead of getting kicked off the team by Trump, the president is desperate enough to need Rudy in a full-time role.

On April 19th, Rudy officially went on leave from the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Today, the executive chairman of the firm, Richard Rosenbaum, announced that Rudy has formally resigned from the firm.

Rosenbaum said in a statement:

“When Rudy Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm, his intent was to play a limited role, for a short period of time, to address specific matters for President Trump. After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm, effective May 9th. I have a great deal of respect [for him] … and consider him a friend.”

The key takeaway is the fact that Trump is desperate enough to need throwaway lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

The latest news from sources is that Prince William is in the middle of a huge predicament, one that could change relationships.

Prince William has to choose to either go to Prince Harry's wedding and stand by his side as the best man or choose to attend a soccer game.

While for most of us it seems like an easy choice. Family over soccer. However, for Prince William, it won't be so easy.

Saturday is not just the big Royal wedding; it's also England's Football Association Cup final against Manchester United and Chelsea. He is expected to be there.

Knowing what we know about Prince William, he would rather be at the wedding than at a soccer game. However, it's not just a soccer game and he's not just a spectator, he's the FA president. He has been for over a decade.

Each and every year, the FA president is expected to be in attendance at the final game at Wembley Stadium. The president's job is also to award the final cup trophy to the winning team.

This long-standing tradition and a popular England sporting event will be a hard one for Prince William to miss.

While this quandary isn't unexpected news to Prince William, he's been thinking about it for months. In an interview with radio broadcaster Rio Ferdinand in January, he expressed his upcoming dilemma.

“It’s a big decision, are we going to Wembley, or are we going to...?” William asking Rio. “You’ve touched on something there, Rio, yeah. I’m still working it out. I’ll see what I can do.”

Even though both events are happening the same day, he may be able to attend both. The wedding is at noon, and the soccer game is at 5:30 p.m.

Being 20 miles apart from each other, he could attend the reception at St. George's Chapel and take his helicopter to Wembley to present the trophy. After that, he could travel back to the evening reception at the Frogmore House.

There is no final word yet as to what Prince William will do. Let's hope he can pull it off!

355,https://web.archive.org/web/20180517203012/http://24trueinfoamerica.com/breaking-60-people-just-found-dead-in-ohio,"The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can’t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in. President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.

With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.

Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.

“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.

During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.

While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not. America does not need more of what comes in illegally over the border, whether it’s people, drugs, or both.

356,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/14/politics/melania-trump-surgery/index.html,"(CNN) First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office.

Trump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention.

""This morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications,"" the first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.

""Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,"" Grisham wrote.

President Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania Trump's surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One.

""Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!"" Trump tweeted.

Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018

Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.

She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.

The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.

Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyoncé, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of ""Scandal.""

On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best . She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.

Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump's husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others.

""I am well-aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,"" she said. ""I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right.""

Melania Trump has also appeared with her husband several times in recent weeks.

In the very least we thought his ethnic name meant there would be some reason to be able to tie him to something other than right-wing terrorism. Now we have that reason.

Dimitrius Pagopogouritz is a liberal whose immigrant parents raised him on welfare in the projects of San Dimas. In a leaked interview with police after the shooting, he admitted he was an Obama-loving moonbat who was looking to “end gun violence” by adding another shooting:

“I just figured if I caused enough damage maybe my school could be the next Parkland.”

But that’s how liberals think, isn’t it? The leak came from a source who is well-known inside the Texas Rangers Inner-City Cooperative that pairs wealthy white folks with impoverished black and Latino kids to make them some extra money mowing lawns and doing some gardening. According to celebrity spokesman Chuck Norris:

“I ended up firing my gardener and his crew of illegals and now I get my get the same quality work for a fraction of the price. These kids aren’t bound by minimum wages or workman’s comp restrictions. They’d be crippled. They do us a favor and we tip them 10 or 20 bucks. For a Saturday of gaining valuable human capital and the reference of a film and TV star? That’s well worth it.”

Donatelliarius Souflakitariopolous, the killer’s grandfather, is currently serving a life sentence for murder and grand theft of more than 6000 pounds of tainted turkey bacon. The two cases aren’t related.

359,https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731/https://yournewswire.com/cnn-ratings-plunge-30-percent/,"CNN is on the verge of permanently closing its doors after its ratings collapsed even more than last week, falling a staggering 30 percent in the second week of May.

While Fox News increased its total viewers by a healthy 6 percent and MSNBC held steady, CNN’s viewership took a nosedive, signalling that the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.

Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN’s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel’s ratings crisis is even more severe.

CNN lies.

Numbers do not…

Last week, during the all-important primetime hours, CNN was only able to average 844K total viewers. During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.

CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.

In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.

Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.

While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.

Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.

Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.

During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.

By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.

MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.

The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.

During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.

The bottom line is that CNN’s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/aviation-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/real-life-rosemarys-baby-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/trump-deep-state-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-30-at-1.53.03-PM-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SYRIAN-GOVERNMENT-FORCES-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ponies-on-Dartmoor_3050657b-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CDC-doctor-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/clinton-sanders-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gaza-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/black-death-east-africa-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/CNN-696x360.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CIA-afghan-heroin-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nancy-pelosi-border-wall-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1414189834514_wps_10_Saturn_s_moon_Titan_in_ul-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kobane-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/CNN.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Snopes-CIA-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/liquid-metal-morphing-electronics.-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/1511651_10152594103870715_1942518842_o.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/state-department-lies-video-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/CNN-678x381.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/chicago-nuclear-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Trump-groundwork-vaccinations-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/antifa-terrorist-texas-church-326x245.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/CNN.jpeg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180522194731/https://yournewswire.com/cnn-ratings-plunge-30-percent/,CNN To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent,[],1526676548.0,https://web.archive.org,

Right Wing News reported that in the weeks before President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran deal, Kerry met with multiple Iranian leaders to try and save it. Jason Osborne, a former senior advisor to Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, took to Twitter to write about Kerry’s treasonous antics in Iran.

“So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians. A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting @realDonaldTrump. The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?” he tweeted.

Trump himself called Kerry out for this on Twitter, pointing out that he may have broken the law.

“The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!” Trump tweeted.

The tweet reads warning: You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word….

You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word…. — 🇺🇸MFLYNNJR🇺🇸 (@mflynnJR) May 21, 2018

t’s now being reported that less than a week after Stefan Halper was confirmed to be an informant for the FBI who was the one who infiltrated the Trump campaign back in 2016, there is now alleged confirmation that the 73-year-old Oxford University professor and former U.S. government official was paid handsomely by the Obama administration starting in 2012 for various research projects.

Halper, who is said to be a longtime CIA and FBI asset, once even reportedly ran a spy-operation on the Jimmy Carter administration during the late 70’s, was recruited by the FBI to spy on several Trump campaign aides during the 2016 U.S. election.

But here is the kicker. An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper?

Interestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page.

Via 100% Fed Up:

“According to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for “RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012),” “RESEARCH AND STUDIES – THE YEAR 2030, (2014)”, “RUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY. (2015),” and “INDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY (2016).”

Halper’s most recent award was noted recently by Trump supporter Jacob Wohl, which piqued the interest of internet researchers who continued the analysis.”

“The second installment of Halper’s 2016 DoD contract is dated July 26, 2017 in the amount of $129,280 – around three months before the FISA warrant on Carter Page was set to expire following repeated renewals signed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and a federal judge.

On July 28, he emailed Page with what the Trump campaign aide describes as a “cordial” communication, which did not seem suspicious to him at the time.

In the email to Page, Halper asks what his plans are post-election, possibly probing for more information. “It seems attention has shifted a bit from the ‘collusion’ investigation to the ‘ contretempts’ [sic] within the White House and, how–or if–Mr. Scaramucci will be accommodated there,” Halper wrote.”

How much time has the MSM spent talking about the massive cash payments sent to Stefan Halper to spy on our President? ZERO.

Halper approached Page during an election-themed conference at Cambridge on July 11, 2016, six weeks before the September 26 Department of Justice payment start date. They would remain in contact for the next 14 months where they frequently met and exchanged emails.

Here is the infamous article via Yahoo News:

“U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.

The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.

Some of those briefed were “taken aback” when they learned about Page’s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser’s talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being “actively monitored and investigated.”

A senior U.S. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News. “It’s on our radar screen,” said the official about Page’s contacts with Russian officials. “It’s being looked at.”

Page is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, located around the corner from Trump Tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries. He declined repeated requests to comment for this story.

Trump first mentioned Page’s name when asked to identify his “foreign policy team” during an interview with the Washington Post editorial team last March. Describing him then only as a “PhD,” Trump named Page as among five advisers “that we are dealing with.” But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him an “informal foreign adviser” who “does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.” Asked this week by Yahoo News, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page “has no role” and added: “We are not aware of any of his activities, past or present.” Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers.

The questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois. In a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S. election and were “beyond the pale.” Also, this week, two senior Democrats — Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee — released a joint statement that went further then what U.S. officials had publicly said about the matter.

“Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,” they said. “At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.” They added that “orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government.”

Page came to the attention of officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. “He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did,” said one U.S. official who served in Russia at the time.

He hasn’t been shy about expressing those views in the U.S. as well. Last March, shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers, Page told Bloomberg News he had been an adviser to, and investor in, Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. He then blamed Obama administration sanctions — imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea — for driving down the company’s stock. “So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,” Page said in the interview. “There’s a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.”

Page showed up again in Moscow in early July, just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president, and once again criticized U.S. policy. Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserted that “Washington and other West capitals” had impeded progress in Russia “through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.”

At the time, Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip, according to a Reuters report.

But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian’s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.” (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as “utterly loyal to Vladimir Putin — a key component to his current standing.” At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.

U.S. intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow — Igor Diveykin. A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.”

Advertisement – story continues below

Just hours after ABC canceled its hit sitcom “Roseanne” due to an ugly racist tweet by its controversial star, Roseanne Barr, the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show.

“We’re excited to announce that ‘Roseanne’ will be coming to Fox this fall,” said Brian Sullivan, Fox Networks Group president and COO. “The controversy regarding Ms. Barr’s racially charged Twitter message, as well as her bigoted attitudes, are just some of the reasons we’re happy to welcome her to the Fox family. And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.”

In her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox’s white supremacist fans.

President Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration’s policies, was thrilled to hear that “Roseanne” would be coming to his favorite network.

“Big news for ‘Roseanne’ fans and everyone who enjoys ‘black’ humor,” tweeted the president on Tuesday night. “I know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.”

“Roseanne” will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.

Assembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states.

According to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether.

Writer Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit.

According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.

To ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.”

So as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. …

The new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses.

This new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers.

Even worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions.

If the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.

Instead they come up with stupid rules, designed to harm those who can least afford it.

We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a tape widely seen all over the country that he’s assaulted women, so I would hope maybe the president of the United States might pay attention of what’s going on and also think about resigning. But if your point is it is not just Al Franken you are absolutely right.”

Not long ago Mitt Romney also stated that President Trump is “trying to divide us up by the color of our skin.”","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211im_/https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5k3tX7aSfEM/WxT_dvws8KI/AAAAAAAAAYs/MA_dMqseD-8L6peLSXYmstoTwdJrrYTKwCLcBGAs/s640/us-muslim-students-against-islamophobia.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211im_/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e1VMZ96Ga1U/WxgAx64w6PI/AAAAAAAAAD8/Zkf7EHaYGfE1o4yU6wzrslUuMUO4GBEEwCLcBGAs/s1600/ct-1527281219-c8p5f81ktb-snap-image-28.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mdHyRC8jkU/Wwl1lTmoAHI/AAAAAAAAAG0/3ZOHeANFPechqXsWJwYt1b6t3IRKqNLDgCLcBGAs/s640/Mitt-romeny-attacks-trump-560x416.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mdHyRC8jkU/Wwl1lTmoAHI/AAAAAAAAAG0/3ZOHeANFPechqXsWJwYt1b6t3IRKqNLDgCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Mitt-romeny-attacks-trump-560x416.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211im_/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2IvAs1TRVno/WxgC8HGIalI/AAAAAAAAAMc/X9IDCVsvcFw08zNhhBNsjY_ktDLO38nkACLcBGAs/s640/bourdain-560x416-560x360.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mdHyRC8jkU/Wwl1lTmoAHI/AAAAAAAAAG0/3ZOHeANFPechqXsWJwYt1b6t3IRKqNLDgCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Mitt-romeny-attacks-trump-560x416.png,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180615072211/http://internationalflashnews.blogspot.com/2018/06/mitt-romney-trump-has-some-very-serious.html,"MITT ROMNEY: ‘TRUMP HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS, HE MUST RESIGN BEFORE WE…’",[],,https://web.archive.org,

According to investigators, Mr. Bourdain was planning to expose pedophile rings connected to Hollywood and D.C. shortly before his death.

His body found Friday after reportedly hanging himself. He was just 61 years old.

Bourdain was fierce critic of Harvey Weinstein and denounced the serial sexual abuser, calling for swift justice to be served.

During his condemnation of Weinstein, he publicly stated that Hillary Clinton had full knowledge of the sexual abuse, and had done so “for years”:

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

..and I am in no way an HRC fan. I’ve been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun, — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) May 2, 2018

It’s no secret that people who cross the Clinton’s wind up dead … mostly from suicide. Just this week, famous designer and Clinton Foundation member, Kate Spade reportedly killed herself. Spade hung herself as well, NYPD officials said. Are Spade’s and Bourdain’s deaths both coincidences?

Newmediacentral.net reports: Back in October of 2017, CNN’s Bourdain made statements regarding Harvey Weinstein, suggesting Hillary Clinton had to know of his history of being a sexual predator. Bourdain’s girlfriend, actress Asia Argento, accused Weinstein of raping her.

know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She's not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) October 11, 2017

The tweet angered Hillary spokesman, Brian Fallon. He took to Twitter to tell Bourdain to “eat a scorpion.” Many other Clinton winged monkeys followed suit.

Mike Huckabee on Monday tore into Robert DeNiro for throwing f-bombs at President Trump, calling the washed up actor an “elite snob.”“Only thing sadder than De Niro's vile rant is that high-toned elite snobs at the event gave him a standing O. Were U raised by wolves? Your hate and contempt works in H'wood, NY & DC, but in the land of ""God, Guns, Grits & Gravy"" ppl pray for you to get over your bitterness,” Huckabee tweeted.

Last night, Anti-Trump actor DeNiro said ““F*** Trump” twice and the audience gave him a standing ovation.

As Deniro was introducing Bruce Springsteen ahead of his Tony Awards performance, the actor blurted F-Bombs at President Trump.

“I just want to say one thing -- F*** Trump,” DeNiro said angrily. The crowd immediately roared in a huge standing ovation from the room. ""It’s no longer down with Trump. It’s f*** Trump.""

CBS bleeped out DeNiro’s F-bombs, but Australia did not censor the word.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://robohash.org/3503bae9f3ae96602a7fe94a58bb7193.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://robohash.org/007cbee5396cbc4305ea002681b3e7be.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://robohash.org/a7fc44290f691cd888b68b59eb4989a1.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/http://noiimages.s3.amazonaws.com/images/redstate/20180416504124516.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://robohash.org/41d68a74cd04dbabad4f6c18ea9081de.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/http://noiimages.s3.amazonaws.com/images/redstate/20170813501146659.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://robohash.org/2ba0d8fec53518ef2736519add5fa315.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnoiimages%2Es3%2Eamazonaws%2Ecom%2Fimages%2Fredstate%2F20180610444455412%2Ejpeg&container=focus', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnoiimages%2Es3%2Eamazonaws%2Ecom%2Fimages%2Fredstate%2F20180610444417317%2Ejpeg&container=focus', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/https://robohash.org/db7390185e74a801f82d4f797b325136.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180615142001im_/http://noiimages.s3.amazonaws.com/images/redstate/20170813501146659.jpg,[],[],,BREAKING: Mike Huckabee Just Fired!,[],,https://web.archive.org,

She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.

Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.

The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.

After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.

“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.

The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Mar

in Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.

Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.

The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.

Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.

Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.

One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:

“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”

But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.

Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.

For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.

Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.

The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.

Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.

“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.

“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”

The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.

I’m sure you’ve seen your fair share of stories on the news and watched it happen in movies. Some people, unfortunately, have even had to experience it first-hand, just like Jennifer and her family.

Please share this story to remind any and all that alcohol and driving are a combination that never belong together. Hopefully, by doing so, we can prevent acts like tragedy occurring in the future.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oprah-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/80de7608-53f0-460c-8947-b5a7d76720d2-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oprah-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/news_m-3.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/moudn-2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Congress_Homeland_Security_41980-1.jpg-6967d_c0-169-4500-2792_s885x516-1-762x360.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/news_m-4.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/child-who-killed-pedophile-escape-sex-trafficking-ring-jailed-life-211171-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/livetrucking-al-112-1141x400.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://livetrucking.al/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/livetrucking-al-107.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0106422-400x240.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/20-24-400x240.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/20-24-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0102212-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/texas_worker-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/texas_worker.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0102212-400x240.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/child-who-killed-pedophile-escape-sex-trafficking-ring-jailed-life-211171-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0106422-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/news_m-2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/texas_worker-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TrumpRNCopenmouth-800x430-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/80de7608-53f0-460c-8947-b5a7d76720d2-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TrumpRNCopenmouth-800x430-400x240.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Congress_Homeland_Security_41980-1.jpg-6967d_c0-169-4500-2792_s885x516-1-762x360.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180619030838/http://flashnewss.club/2018/06/09/trumps-dhs-secretary-confirms-they-are-preparing-to-arrest-sanctuary-city-leaders/,Trump’s DHS Secretary Confirms They Are Preparing To Arrest Sanctuary City Leaders,[],1528581122.0,https://web.archive.org,

The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.

Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.

Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:

Compromise

The two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.

Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.

No Compromise

In the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.

Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.

Confidence vote

For a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.

Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.

Merkel resigns

Should the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.

Split on the right

The CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-right’s Bavarian chapter — the CDU operates in all of Germany’s 16 states except Bavaria.

So a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSU’s position.

A hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkel’s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. “We should all remain calm,” he said.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/20-24-400x240.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/child-who-killed-pedophile-escape-sex-trafficking-ring-jailed-life-211171-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/57f977b92bc08c494494dc40ed0ae92b?s=46&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/news_m-4.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0106422.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0102212-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oprah-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/child-who-killed-pedophile-escape-sex-trafficking-ring-jailed-life-211171-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/news_m-3.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/news_m-2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/few.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oprah-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shepard-smith-01-1280x720.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/texas_worker-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0106422-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/80de7608-53f0-460c-8947-b5a7d76720d2-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/80de7608-53f0-460c-8947-b5a7d76720d2.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/20-24-80x80.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TrumpRNCopenmouth-800x430-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0102212-400x240.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/TrumpRNCopenmouth-800x430-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/80de7608-53f0-460c-8947-b5a7d76720d2-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/texas_worker-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shepard-smith-01-1280x720-1000x600.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_20180617-0106422-400x240.png']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812im_/http://flashnewss.club/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shepard-smith-01-1280x720-1000x600.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180624033812/http://flashnewss.club/2018/06/11/breaking-shep-smith-to-be-canned-because-he-cant-control-his-hate-for-donald-trump/,BREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Can’t Control His Hate For Donald Trump,[],1528685446.0,https://web.archive.org,

375,https://web.archive.org/web/20180625094426/https://yournewswire.com/senate-report-clinton-children-human/,"Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an “unknown number” of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called “caregivers,” according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media.

These children were then sexually abused, starved, and forced into child labor, according to the Senate report. Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.

NY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling of migrants.

“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.

The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.

The Senate’s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.

However, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.

The agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015.

Obama is Holding Secret Meetings to OVERTAKE the White House,[],,http://redstatewatcher.com,
378,https://web.archive.org/web/20180713162303/https://lidblog.com/illegal-immigrant-mexican-kids/,"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.

It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.

His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: The Democrat Party Has A New 2018 Message Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.

Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.

“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.

But the program was a surprise to Mexico

“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”

Regarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.

Below is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.

﻿

Note: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.

379,https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com:80/mexico-next-president-invasion-1-a/,"For the mainstream media to say that illegal immigration isn’t an issue they really need to look at the world around them and see how things really are out there.

For decades there have been people that came to the United States illegally, but it’s only in the past year or so that it seems that people have been doing it just to spite the system.

People don’t mass organize like this without someone leading the charge.

Currently, ahead of all other candidates, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will likely be the next President of Mexico.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as “AMLO,” has been openly telling his people to flood the U.S. border. What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise…

He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.

Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.

AMLO’s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.

Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico’s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.

Reported by 100percentfedup: Well…at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what’s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades…

Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America.

La Raza aka “The Race” is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups:

GEORGE SOROS’S OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty.

THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO… Andrés Manuel López Obrador aka AMLO:

(From the Daily Caller) […] “And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,” Obrador said, adding that immigrants “must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.” He then declared it as “a human right we will defend.”

The Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.

From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.

380,http://dailyheadlines.net/burka-clad-woman-runs-over-baby-gets-away-with-crime-for-1-stunning-reason/,"A woman in Columbus, Ohio, was arrested, charged and convicted after she hit and killed a 7-month-old baby with her car.

Muhuba Mohamed was found guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide after she struck a man who was pushing an infant in a stroller along the side of the road. Mohamed then crashed into a house.

The man pushing the stroller was identified as 23-year-old Kenan Ferebee, and the child was his 7-month-old son, Micah.

The baby was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The child’s father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported.

A witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.

“Not one of those single things amounts to recklessness,” Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. “But when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.”

Mohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.

“If an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,” one Mad World News reader commented on the site’s Facebook page. “She should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I’m sure she won’t get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.”

“Define for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness,” another wrote. “Maybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges. Where is justice? If a Caucasian teenager did this… You finish the sentence.”","['https://politicalmayhem.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen_Shot_2017-10-16_at_11.33.18_AM.png', 'https://dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-06-at-1.02.16-PM-750x465.png', 'https://dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-1.52.43-PM-750x465.png', 'https://dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-11-at-9.28.16-PM-750x465.png', 'https://dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/themes/newseqo/assets/images/logo/logo-dark.png', 'https://dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-001DailyHeadlinesLogoDesign1.png', 'https://politicalmayhem.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/westervilleaccident.jpg']",https://dailyheadlines.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-06-at-1.02.16-PM-750x465.png,[],[],https://dailyheadlines.net/somali-car-baby/,"Somali Immigrant Crashes Car Into Ohio Families Home, Killing The Infant At Home – Daily Headlines",[],,http://dailyheadlines.net,

The despicable display reached the height of annoyance during every ego-stroking awards ceremony since President Trump was elected. All have turned into a Trump-trashing session for pissed of celebrities to get far too much off their chest about our unapologetic leader.

However, not everyone in Hollywood shares the same opinion as the most outspoken offender, Meryl Streep, as Kurt Russell just showed her and all of Trump’s other famous foes that it’s time to shut up about our president.

If you haven’t heard much from Russell lately, it’s because he falls into the rare category of celebrities who isn’t crying over Hillary Clinton’s loss and doesn’t feel that he needs to make his political opinions known. He’s simply doing what he’s paid well to do and wishes others in the biz would too. Since they continue to throw tantrums and trash Trump on a public stage, Russell reached his breaking point and finally fired back hard.

“This is a business that’s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent,” Russell began in his blistering beratement of these overpaid crybabies after what Streep said at the Golden Globes. “I don’t begrudge them that. I’m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways,” he added, as reported by the American Lookout. “But yeah, we think differently, and maybe that’s cut me out of some things. I don’t care,” he said before dropping a brutal announcement on these Streep and her lemmings that left them burning.

Explaining that they’re not empowered in this business by their disgraceful attitudes against our leaders, the badass actor said they better be prepared to put their money where their nasty mouths are since they could be out of work. “People know I get along great with all kinds of directors, all kinds of actors. And I tell you, you hire me, I will show up, 24/7, and I will give you 100%. I will help you fix whatever problems come up. You hire me, I’m your boy. It’s just, it’s all about the work. And when that’s done, I am done.”

Kurt has said recently that “the last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political,” which he just proved by clearly pointing out that nobody cares what celebrities have to say about politics, and that their obnoxious behavior only shows how unemployable they are. They need to just stick to what they are overpaid to do and leave the rest to the adults in charge.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/After-Deutsch-Attacks-Trump-Supporters-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tw-1.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fonda-Just-Got-Devastating-News-After-His-Sick-Fantasies-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21a8b8bedf3be31f5843161dcf096f35?s=46&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Huckabee-Got-The-Best-Revenge-Ever-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/After-Laura-Bush-Attacked-Trump-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Rush-Limbaugh-Gives-Them-Brutal-Surprise-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/estwood.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Huckabee-Just-Exposed-Dirty-Secret-Behind-Dem’s-SCOTUS-Hypocrisy.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Huckabee-Goes-Full-Papa-Bear-After-Restaurant-Turns-Away-Daughter-Because-of-Her-Job-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/She-Embarrassed-Them-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fonda-Just-Got-Devastating-News-After-His-Sick-Fantasies-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/She-Embarrassed-Them-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/After-Deutsch-Attacks-Trump-Supporters-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/After-Laura-Bush-Attacked-Trump-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Melania-Trump-Just-Did-the-Incredible-for-Brave-Border-Patrol-Officers.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Rush-Limbaugh-Gives-Them-Brutal-Surprise-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Huckabee-Goes-Full-Papa-Bear-After-Restaurant-Turns-Away-Daughter-Because-of-Her-Job-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tw-2.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Beans-As-Gaetz-Gives-Him-The-Drilling-He’ll-Never-Forget.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tw.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/829853922c26a7bfa1039957286883f2?s=46&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FBI-Informant-Just-Pulled-Out-a-Piece-of-Paper-on-Live-TV-That-Made-Hillary-Clinton-SHIVER-in-Fear-80x80.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FBI-Informant-Just-Pulled-Out-a-Piece-of-Paper-on-Live-TV-That-Made-Hillary-Clinton-SHIVER-in-Fear-400x240.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/estwood-1000x600.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Huckabee-Got-The-Best-Revenge-Ever-400x240.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100im_/http://twentyeightmay.pw/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/estwood-1000x600.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180712083100/http://twentyeightmay.pw/kurt-russel-just-showed-overpaid-celebs-its-time-to-shut-up-about-trump-hits-them-where-it-hurts/,Kurt Russel Just SHOWED Overpaid Celebs It’s Time To Shut Up About Trump – Hits Them Where It Hurts!,[],1529774337.0,https://web.archive.org,

Regardless of all the backlash, Stephanie Wilkinson has doubled down and is now claiming she does not repent what she did Friday.

All this mess started when Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, together with her Husband along with six other friends decided to go out to dinner this past Friday night in the Red Hen Restaurant.

As Sanders along with the rest inside her celebration nibbled in what we can only surmise as mediocre crackers and cheese, the owner of the restaurant has been called to the institution where she asked Sanders to return to the terrace with her.

When they got to the patio Wilkerson told her the restaurant had”certain criteria” like”honesty, and empathy, and collaboration.” So she asked Sanders to depart.

She agreed because Sanders is a lady. She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration.

Vice noted:

But despite all the backlash she’s gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing.

“We simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one.”

When Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team was”a little concerned,” Wilkinson told the Post.

She headed to the restaurant, and–while Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboards–called the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders’ treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone.

Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant had”certain criteria” like”honesty, and compassion, and collaboration,” Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped.

Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called it”filthy,” and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its business–beginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp.

I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, it’s dirty on the inside!

The restaurant’s Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half.

Piggybacking on Trump’s dig on the area being”filthy,” several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staff”un-American hateful bigots.”

“I’ve a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals.”

Saturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadn’t any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling it”filthy” on his Twitter page.

Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration. The Restaurant’s Yelp page currently has the company at one star and a half.

While on the other side, liberals were pleased to leave this slum a 5-star rating although they threw a hissy fit every time a Christian baker didn’t need to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding a few years back.

Wilkerson went on to confirm to the Article she feels like this is the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable decisions and actions to maintain their morals.

Odd which she’d cite morals as it pertains in the side that amuses a sexual predator such as Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary who dragged his accusers through the mud in order to conserve her own political ambitions.

Senior Twitter engineer caught on video boasting during Project Veritas investigation

An undercover investigation by Project Veritas has uncovered mass political bias at the highest levels of Twitter.

One of Twitter's senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president's private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice to ""help with their little investigation.""

The high-level engineer, Clay Haynes, a self-confessed ""bleeding-heart liberal,"" boasted to covert investigators that his team can access all activity of every user on the site, and can even retrieve deleted messages.

After confessing that the social media sites extreme monitoring of its users was ""big brother-ish,"" he admitted that Twitter disclosed all of Donald Trump's messages to the DOJ, saying:

""Even the ones he’s deleted, any direct messages""

A Project Veritas undercover investigation has revealed a senior network security engineer at Twitter stating that his company is “more than happy” to turn over the private communications and deleted tweets of President Donald Trump to the Department of Justice.

If true, it is yet unknown whether Twitter is voluntarily disclosing this sensitive information or acting under a court order.

Twitter is currently in the midst of defending itself from left-leaning criticism that President Trump hasn’t been removed from the enormous media platform for violations of Twitter’s Terms of Service.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Clay Haynes has been employed by Twitter since September 2016. On January 3, 2018, he met with a Project Veritas undercover journalist (UCJ) at Stookey's Club Moderne in San Francisco.

Using a hidden video camera, the Veritas UCJ captures Haynes stating that “we’re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation” of President Trump.

When prompted by the UCJ, Mr. Haynes provides additional details, “Basically, giving them every single tweet that he’s posted. Even the ones he’s deleted, any direct messages, any mentions…”

“…he’s dangerous, I don’t like him and he’s a terrible human being and I want to get rid of him,” the self-described bleeding-heart liberal Haynes says in the video about President Trump.

“In fact, we had internal reviews about that…”

On January 7, 2018, James O’Keefe himself went undercover with Haynes at Morton’s Steakhouse in San Francisco to confirm if Twitter was working with the Department of Justice to hand over Trump’s tweets and DMs.

When pressed about looking at Donald Trump’s messages, Haynes explained: “We have a subpoena process for that very reason.”

The conversation continued:

James O’Keefe: “Are you working with DOJ currently on that?” Clay Haynes: “I can’t comment, even if I knew, I wouldn’t comment.”

© Youtube Twitter has access to all user's private data according to Haynes

“The fact is, even if Haynes was just speculating about helping Justice, his admission shows a clear and dangerous political bias at the highest levels of Twitter,” says Project Veritas founder and President James O’Keefe in the video.

“The question is: by Twitter giving private information about the President to the Justice Department, are they breaking the law, betraying a trust, following an official request or satisfying a political agenda by leading a crusade against the President.”

Describing himself as the bouncer of the network, Mr. Haynes also details the level of information Twitter retains in its databases about their hundreds of millions of users.

The Project Veritas Twitter investigation is the fourth installment of its American Pravda series.

In Part I, Veritas disclosed that CNN's Russia coverage is driven by ratings and a political agenda, but in reality, using the words of CNN Political Commentator Van Jones is just a “nothing burger.”

Part II disclosed a political bias at The New York Times which forced executive responses and an immediate change of their social media policy.

Part III exposed political bias at The Washington Post and brought to light that the far-reaching narratives of the paper’s editorial board are not rooted in the factual findings of their subject-matter expert reporters.

President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

Sponsored Links

Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.

While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.

Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”

Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:

“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“

The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.

Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.

The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.

When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.

Correction: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President Trump’s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump’s June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors.

President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd’s plea.

According to Bush’s spokesman McGrath, the former President died “peacefully in his afternoon nap”.

Bush, who lost his wife Barbara Bush was discharged from a Maine hospital earlier this month after being admitted due to low blood pressure.

He was earlier on admitted to Southern Maine Health Care “after experiencing low blood pressure and fatigue.”

McGrath said days later that Bush was “in good spirits” as the hospital addressed his blood pressure.

While still in the Maine hospital, Bush said on Twitter that he was passing the time reading a book about his relationship with his late wife, former first lady Barbara Bush.

Bush was previously admitted to a Houston hospital in April after contracting an infection that spread to his blood the day after a funeral was held for his wife. He was discharged from that hospital on May 4.

This is breaking news. More details follow shortly.

389,https://babylonbee.com/news/senate-democrats-demand-supreme-court-nominee-not-be-unduly-influenced-by-u-s-constitution/,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Still reeling from Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn’t yet another crony of something called “The Constitution,” Senate Democrats announced Friday.

“Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. “And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”

Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”

“We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.

Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”","['https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10001-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-7152-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1283-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1930-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-329-thumb.jpg', 'https://babylonbee.com/img/logo-dark.png', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=326751097945685&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-6887-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-4494-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10216-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10246-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10230-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-5263-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-5062-1-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10223-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-7454-2-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-995-thumb.jpg', 'https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-8312-1-thumb.jpg']",https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg,[],[],https://babylonbee.com/news/senate-democrats-demand-supreme-court-nominee-not-be-unduly-influenced-by-u-s-constitution,Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution,[],,https://babylonbee.com,

He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.

From Fox News:

Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.

Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.

While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.

“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”

He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”

It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.

But it obviously raises a concerning question.

There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.

And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.

The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.

Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.

This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.

And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.”

The protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didn’t feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran.

There’s a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here.

But it could be interesting if it’s the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/e51292a827e04830c3e10d8685a93751/5B35F6A9/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/27891277_268989186971440_8306674064240410624_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/4e354de0538412896bd903f9e6f61b2a/5B3EA9A9/t51.2885-15/e35/c130.0.334.334/28157755_211856532887627_8221348251073249280_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/230bfd297b028a4d43348cc9e74a822a/5B446DBB/t51.2885-15/e35/c210.0.526.526/28429939_324752037930845_2030328235929108480_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americanewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2017/10/11111-copy-4.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=48&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/8605832539d2f079f433f302d0797f44/5B39265B/t51.2885-15/e35/c140.0.360.360/28430573_2073817419529589_3630687162711670784_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americanewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2017/11/logo4-copy.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americandailynews.org/wp-content/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-large.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/d7f8ed3e94e0e4bfdd274256ca40b571/5B3C39CB/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c135.0.810.810/27575076_364135747388815_5001059270922338304_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/f7a98ca5d234b625b55094fae6806ed9/5AAA7528/t51.2885-15/e35/c72.0.576.576/28156087_428333217622959_3770865966016102400_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3335e62dd9862a14579cedd634af3fb3?s=64&d=mm&r=g', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/09e8611a63fe0d9e89e3521fb7e05195/5AAA21A7/t51.2885-15/e35/c72.0.576.576/28156251_2020053334876146_1300768100139925504_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americanewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2017/11/homepage-diamond-and-silk3.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americandailynews.org/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/utils/temp/c95uX-1530764436.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/b6f3a4176374df240af37e86b1a0f435/5AAB0493/t51.2885-15/e35/c72.0.576.576/28427341_359659251182793_3917344769084227584_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americandailynews.org/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/assets/img/captcha-loading.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americandailynews.org/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/utils/temp/NcGrP-1530764436.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/1851f598b6e214c4cf0da2eaab611d74/5B3ACD55/t51.2885-15/e35/c140.0.360.360/28158222_2237074193187215_3166062183360495616_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/c50f0a580f6b89e1c16ea7dff7721132/5B372FC7/t51.2885-15/e35/c236.0.608.608/28754394_177958486326558_6966878038663364608_n.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://diamondandsilk.americanewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2017/10/11111.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://www.chicksonright.com/youngcons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-02-at-2.48.20-PM_resized-1.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=64&d=mm&r=g']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135im_/https://www.chicksonright.com/youngcons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-02-at-2.48.20-PM_resized-1.png,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180705064135/https://www.americandailynews.org/2018/07/02/iranian-official-drops-bombshell-obama-secretly-gave-citizenship-to-2500-iranians-as-part-of-nuke-deal/,Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama Secretly Gave Citizenship to 2500 Iranians as Part of Nuke Deal,[],1530460800.0,https://web.archive.org,

392,https://conservativedailypost.com/us-representatives-promise-implement-of-un-gun-control-plans/,"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Most liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.

Many people ascertain that the United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it certainly sounds like representatives of the United States promised “full implementation” of the UN’s gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

The UN conference “provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,” according to politifact.

Politifact also claimed, “Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights.” Adding,

“‘The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,’ Dorminey wrote in an email. ‘The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion — especially across borders — that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions.'”

“‘Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade — not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for.'”

However, the wording here is suspicious.

The Third Review Conference for the UN’s Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‘representatives’ at the conference agreed to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce “proper management” of “small arms and light weapons” stockpiles.

It appears that the agreement could also include ‘stockpiles’ owned by American citizens.

According to some, the United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name. Many think they are hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.

The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.

This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‘illicit’ ammunition and firearms.

If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN’s gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.

However, it gets worse still. The ‘Programme of Action’ also allows UN ‘peacekeepers’ to go to member nations to ‘assist’ in meeting the goals of the program.

So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‘help’ speed the process up.

The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.

Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).

Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‘coordinated approaches’ nationally for implementing the PoA.

Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.

Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‘national point of contact’ to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.

Fifth, they promised to ‘make better use’ of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‘in compliance’ with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‘non-proliferation,’ which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.

Finally, they agreed to ‘significantly reduce’ illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‘voluntary surrender’ programmes and ‘illicit weapons’ recovery.

In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.

If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.

This agreement seems wildly unconstitutional, but UN officials don’t see it that way.

By requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it seems to violate the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are “reserved to the states respectively.”

The idea of a ‘liaison’ between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.

Perhaps it’s time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.

Perhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the ‘illicit firearms trade.’","['https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Group-Optin.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vaccine-vials-3-780x392.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Parag-Agrawal-780x392.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/COVID-VAX-3-780x392.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=323488158144055&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dr-Angelique-Coetzee-780x392.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Just-In-Second-Tenth-Amendments-Forfeit-US-Agrees-To-UN-‘Program’-Confiscating-‘Small-Arms’.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/themes/conservativedailypost/img/logo_white.png', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Austin-Lewis-93x93.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/US-Representatives-Promise-Implement-Of-UN-Gun-Control-Plans-780x392.jpg', 'https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lindsey-Graham-780x392.jpg']",https://conservativedailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Just-In-Second-Tenth-Amendments-Forfeit-US-Agrees-To-UN-‘Program’-Confiscating-‘Small-Arms’.jpg,[],"['Austin Lewis', 'April Matthews']",https://conservativedailypost.com/us-representatives-promise-implement-of-un-gun-control-plans/,US Representatives Agree To ‘Illicit’ UN Gun-Control Plans,[],1530787711.0,https://conservativedailypost.com,

394,https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012926/https://yournewswire.com/broward-county-sheriff-fired/,"Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.

According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.

From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.

The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.

“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.

According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.

The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.

Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.

It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.

Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.

In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.

Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.

Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”

The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history.

During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment.

“I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said.

“Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said.

Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country.

In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gmo_prop37_crowd-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fiona-Woolf-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/diet-pepsi-aspartame-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HSI-PharmaBrain-Scan-300x250-1.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fbi-informant-hillary-russia-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/robert-de-niro-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/british-troops-UK-streets-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/1511651_10152594103870715_1942518842_o.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broward-sheriff-fired-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillsborogh-investigator-murdered-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/snopes-mikkelson-censoring-conservatives-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Iranian-Navy-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/is-jihadists-behead-frenchman.si_-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/USC-prof-kill-whites-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fbi-leak-buzzfeed-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/news_punch_logo.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mummy-rabbit_black-snake-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rand-paul-hillary-collusion-russia-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/911-grand-jury-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broward-sheriff-fired-678x381.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/breastfeeding-136395579138003901-150121124128-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mueller-nra-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/french-alps-plane-crash-military-timeline-of-events-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/peter-strzok-cia-1-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/csis-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Trump-arrest-schiff-for-treason-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broward-sheriff-fired-800x450.jpg.optimal.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Image_galleryImage_Lord_Brittan_a_member_of_-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927im_/https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broward-sheriff-fired-1200x630-cropped.jpg.optimal.jpg,[],['Sean Adl-Tabatabai'],https://web.archive.org/web/20201109012927/https://newspunch.com/broward-county-sheriff-fired/,Broward County Sheriff Fired For Lying About Parkland,[],1530642221.0,https://web.archive.org,
395,https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647/http://www.opreminfo.com/2018/07/10/pope-says-that-the-rights-of-muslim-migrants-trump-any-safety-concerns-that-you-might-have-with-them-in-your-country/,"Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants, saying their safety should take precedence over national security concerns and that they should not be subjected to collective deportations.

His challenge to politicians, made in a comprehensive position paper on migrants and refugees, again appeared to put him at odds with the restrictive policies of a number of governments dealing with growing popular anti-immigrant sentiment.

“Solidarity must be concretely expressed at every stage of the migratory experience – from departure through journey to arrival and return,” he said in a message ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees.

Calling for “broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally,” he said the human rights and dignity of all migrants had to be respected regardless of their legal status.

“The principle of the centrality of the human person … obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security,” he said.

This appeared to be a reference to fears voiced in many European countries that refugees inflows could lead to security problems in their host countries. He said it was necessary “to ensure that agents in charge of border control are properly trained.”

He called for “alternative solutions to detention” for illegal immigrants and said “collective and arbitrary expulsions of migrants and refugees are not suitable solutions”.

Francis said migrants should be seen as “a true resource for the communities that welcome them” and be given freedom of movement, access to means of communication, access to justice and everyday rights such as opening a bank account.

Francis, an Argentine who has made defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, has criticized anti-immigrant stands by national leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump. Last year, Francis condemned then-candidate Trump’s intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

Migrant children deserved particular protection, the pope said. They “must be spared any form of detention related to migratory status,” guaranteed access to primary and secondary education and have the right to remain when they come of age.

Francis’s message immediately drew the ire of the right-wing Northern League party in Italy because it implicitly supported a controversial law proposal that would grant citizenship to children who are born in Italy of immigrant parents.

“The universal right to a nationality should be recognized and duly certified for all children at birth,” the pope said.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ffve-800x445-240x160.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3-240x160.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-6-678x381-800x445-240x160.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4-8-240x160.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_337132874.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_649637962.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_241294162.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_164474051.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9876789876789.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flight-Crew-Takes-A-Knee-And-Walks-Off-Leaving-New-Orleans-Saints-Stranded-On-Runway-1-800x445-240x160.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_622381814.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/travel_651306859.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_504293641.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_324195443.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_514951309.jpeg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9876789876789.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647/http://www.opreminfo.com/2018/07/10/pope-says-that-the-rights-of-muslim-migrants-trump-any-safety-concerns-that-you-might-have-with-them-in-your-country/,Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country,[],1531152000.0,https://web.archive.org,

We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…

THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:

‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.

He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.

While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’

“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”

Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.

IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.

Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.

He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.

The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.

Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’

The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.

That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.

‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.

The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.

For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.

Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.

Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.

‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’

‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’

Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’

Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.

He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.

‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.

‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’

His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things.

Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him.

Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’

The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?”

‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’

‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’

Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.

He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome.

He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine.

His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare.

Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting.

His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them.

After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can.

Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons?

He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago.

His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it.

The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen.

He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything.

He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.

AREN’T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT!

The expected testimony centered on a notorious pharmaceutical company who gave money to the Clinton Foundation in a bid to cover up their drug price gouging crimes.

According to reports, ‘US Federal Grand Jury had been impaneled to hear testimony from witnesses presented before it by FBI investigators and/or US Attorneys’.

On July 7th, the report continues, a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a two-story house. The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.

‘As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD’s request for information about this “event”, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion– Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73—with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database “target hit” on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a “probable witness” against the Clinton Foundation.,

‘Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey—and whose inclusion in the SVR’s database of “potential witnesses” against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a “central identified and named figure” in the creation of a document titled “Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine” for the New Jersey Department of Education.’

‘Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis—that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death—and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)—and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its “emergency administration” led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it—and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.’

‘Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a “main target” person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history—that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation—and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education—and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions—that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses’ offices throughout the United States—with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools—and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their “EpiPen Law” that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.’

‘Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch—who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens—became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.—with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million—and whose “protection” for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin’s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.’

‘To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her “active and knowing” participation in the United States opioid crisis—that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year—nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma—who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a “blind eye” to their flooding of America with opioids—and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin’s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.’

‘This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee—and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennessee—that was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his State—and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:

“Purdue’s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.

Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative – that long-term use of opioids didn’t create addicts but instead caused “pseudo addictive” symptoms.

The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessee’s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.

Purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher “quality of life.”

The firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin – Purdue’s financial rainmaker – was better for patients than other opioids on the market.”

74-year-old former UK Ambassador to the US, savagely beaten by thugs

© press Sir Christopher Meyer, 74, savagely beaten close to death by protestors

An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he 'welcomed' the US President to the UK on Thursday.

74-year-old Sir Christopher Meyer has been hospitalized with his injuries after he was set upon by a mob of thugs in London at around 3 pm local time.

Sir Meyer, who is the former UK Ambassador to the United States, was targetted after he publically expressed his support for Donald Trump's visit.

The retired diplomat was left with a bleeding and swollen eye socket, a burst lip and a possible broken nose.

Violent riots have gripped the nation's capital as citizens take to the streets in a shameful display of fascism and intolerance.

Meyer's wife, Baroness Catherine Meyer, has expressed her anger at the brutal attack, saying it ""was politically motivated,"" adding: ""It's just not right.""

""I'm absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality. They really beat him. It's appalling — like something you would see in a war zone,"" she said.

“He looks terrible,"" she continues.

""His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken.

“He hasn’t had an x-ray yet.

""He doesn’t remember anything.

""The first thing he remembers is the police.

“He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.

“Nothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly.

""London is such a beautiful, wonderful city.

""We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.""

Daily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador.

He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.

As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.

After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.

He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.

The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.

He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.

Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.

Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.

Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.

A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:

""Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.

""A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.

""They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue.

""A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.""

Thoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday. He has been doing a lot of media about how important the Trump visit is.

© press Violent protestors are flooding the streets on London in a shameful display of intolerance.

Baroness Meyer's comments come as police struggle to cope with a wave of violence across Sadiq Kahn's London.

Evening Standard reports: Activists attending a ""Welcome Trump"" protest on Saturday will march from the US Embassy in Nine Elms to Whitehall, where organizers say they intend to disrupt a ""free Tommy Robinson"" rally.

Scotland Yard says the protests will be subject to a series of restrictions “due to concerns of serious public disorder and disruption to the community.”

These include limiting the protests to specific times and routes and not allowing motor vehicles to take part.

The huge 'Stop Trump' rally in central London on Friday, will see 70,000 violent protestors flood the British capital.

Chief Superintendent Elaine Van-Orden said:

“We police hundreds of public events and demonstrations in central London every year and we always facilitate peaceful protest.

""We have such serious concerns about this event on Saturday, July 14, that we have made the decision to impose conditions under the Public Order Act.

""We have a duty to ensure that the community can go about their daily business not unduly impacted by demonstrations taking place.

""Our message is simple: if you wish to protest peacefully, that is your right and we want to work with you.

""If you commit criminal acts or breach the conditions of the event, you are liable to be arrested.”","['http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/trump-ap-300.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/jphn-kery-29291.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/jud-3ksjksa.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/videos/images/biden-188.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/british-politician-beaten-protestors-supporting-trump-413718.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/democrats-hillary-clinton-best-option-2024-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/driver-smashed-car-home-homeowner-shoot-dead-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/feed/images/democrats-rebuttal-nunes-memo-t.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/ted-cruz-jan-6-3.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/donald-trump-fake-news.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/lond-399sa.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/british-politician-beaten-protestors-supporting-trump-m13718.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/assets/ads/steve-quayle-ad.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/steve-harvey-woke-killed-comedy-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/man-who-threatened-to-kil-.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/california-tax-39s.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/bab-d-38821.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/Biden-america-soviet.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/23m-afghans-39.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/sphere/images/florida-school-girls-plot-kill-15-drink-blood-t251018.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/usa-today-destigmatizing-pedophilia-misunderstood-t12122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/british-politician-beaten-protestors-supporting-trump-313718.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/features/images/russia-93kmsa.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/scientist-selling-research-chinese-communist-party-t6122.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/assets/img/telegram-tap.png', 'https://neonnettle.com/news/images/british-politician-beaten-protestors-supporting-trump-m13718.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/features/images/epstein-nbc.jpg', 'http://www.neonnettle.com/news/images/bide-doj-domestic-terrorism-unit-t12122.jpg']",https://neonnettle.com/news/images/british-politician-beaten-protestors-supporting-trump-m13718.jpg,[],['Jay Greenberg'],https://neonnettle.com/news/4514-british-politician-beaten-by-protestors-for-welcoming-trump-to-the-uk-,British Politician Beaten by Protestors for 'Welcoming Trump to the UK',[],,http://www.neonnettle.com,
400,https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116/https://yournewswire.com/puerto-rico-mayor-fraud-disaster/,"San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz’s party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds, just months after she appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.

Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and billions of dollars to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still pointed a finger at the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.

As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.

“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.

Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.

Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.

According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.

Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.

“The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.

“U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.

“Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.

Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.

At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.

Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?

There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.

“Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed.

The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.

However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/antifa-terrorist-texas-church-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/transgenderism-harms-children-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dennisskinner-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CDC-doctor-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tom-perez-80x60.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/homeless-poor-people-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/UFO-mothership-NASA-sun-photo-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/san-juan-mayor.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Norwich-Paedophile-Ring-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/san-juan-mayor-696x366.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/teenage-rape-nypd-silence-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/104096645RestrictedWinnieNEWS-large_transeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/antidepressants-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3AEF732D00000578-0-image-a-11_1480619162770-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Trump-groundwork-vaccinations-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/article-2729797-20AB535500000578-403_634x476-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/russian-consulate-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woman-kills-father-pedo-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GOP-blocked-uranium-investigation-80x60.jpeg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/UZWE43RUI6MR77GJB6FAE6OWZI.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FBI-antifa-domestic-terrorists-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-16_144021-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/san-juan-mayor-678x368.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wolf-blitzer-cnn-trump-assassination-80x60.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/san-juan-mayor.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180717235116/https://yournewswire.com/puerto-rico-mayor-fraud-disaster/,Puerto Rico Mayor Facing Fraud Charges Over $3M In Federal Disaster Relief,[],1531669476.0,https://web.archive.org,

The famous actor, 89, says he’ll be lucky to see 2019:

“I’ve had a good run. They say I’m probably gonna be on the list of dead people at the awards show next year. Me and that damned empty chair. Guaranteed. Why can’t folks just let that go?”

Eastwood, always in good spirits, says that he’s made a good life for his family and taken care of them with trust funds, homes and large insurance policies and that he’d like to see his personal estate go to something…bigger:

“I have been able to sit here in this magnificent ranch watching as President Trump made America great again in just a few months. He’ll persevere through the witch hunt and I will do what I can to make his journey easier.”

Eastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest:

“We’ll be able to sit up there, far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state and the deep levels of corruption still inside the Justice department and FBI, and strategize without worrying about being called before a federal prosecutor for it.”

Clint Eastwood will be remembered for a lot of things after he’s gone, but this may be the biggest.

Another dead body has turned up. The remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin’s New York apartment. Hillary Clinton is silent on the topic as Huma’s neighbors told the cops they believe the police investigation has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction.

On Tuesday evening, a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a New York apartment block where Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin own a home. The 48-year-old, who police say lived at the premises, was found unconscious inside the machine and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her cause of death has yet to be announced by the medical examiner.

Police had been called to the block at 1 Irving Place in Union Square just before 5pm. The deceased woman, whose identity has been withheld until police notify her family, was found by a building maintenance worker.

Police do not yet know how she ended up in the trash compactor, but neighbors at the luxury apartment block told NBC they believed the police presence was related to Weiner’s recent conviction for sexting an underage girl:

Police say a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a luxury residential building in Manhattan’s Union Square. Crime scene investigators were on the scene at 1 Irving Place Tuesday evening, collecting evidence in the bizarre and grisly death. Police say it’s not clear yet how the 48-year-old woman died, but her body was found at around 5 p.m. Her purse was found near the trash chute where it appears she went in. Neighbors said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building’s famous resident, Anthony Weiner. The disgraced former congressman is still listed as a resident at the building, though he’s currently serving time in prison for sexting an underage girl.

Security footage also shows the woman walking into the apartment building shortly before she was found inside the machine, PIX11 reported:

A woman’s body was found inside of a trash compactor near Union Square on Tuesday, police said. Officers found the body at the Zeckendorf Towers on Irving Place just before 5 p.m., officials said. The woman, identified only as being 48 years old, was unconscious and unresponsive when police arrived on scene. Security camera shows the woman entering the building shortly before her body was found in the trash compactor, sources said. Property belonging to the woman, who entered the compactor area on the 27th floor, was found inside the compact room, police sources said. Police have not yet released her name. The circumstances around her death are not yet clear.

According to Daily Mail, Weiner and Abedin have owned an apartment at the address for 16 years, which was listed for rent at $11,900 a month on the same day he pleaded guilty to sexting a 15-year-old girl. Abedin also filed for divorce that same day. The listing, posted on May 19, 2017, was taken down just days later, though it is unclear as to whether the estranged couple found a renter, or if the property was taken off the market for other reasons.

Their modern apartment, located on the 14th and 15th floors, has a view that overlooks Union Square Park and extends out over the midtown skyline. There are 670 units in the apartment block, divided into four blocks: Gramercy, Village, Park, and University. There is a communal pool, gym, and grassy rooftop for residents to enjoy.

The former congressman, who is currently in prison, is eligible to begin his three years supervised release in August 2019.

It certainly will be interesting to see what they come up with in order to explain away what appears to be a murder at the apartment building where Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner own a home. Will they call it a robbery, like in the case of Seth Rich? Perhaps the better question is this: What did this woman know about Hillary Clinton?","['https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HillaryHumaDumpster-678x356.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/composite_16080647398198-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/composite_16099519801330-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HillaryHumaDumpster.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/biden-reporter-school-closings-feat-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/composite_16081393632037-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/composite_16083104997343-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MelaniaHillary-326x245.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/composite_16079715381470-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/composite_16099652265526-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/composite_16099587804428-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mwnpostwebsitebanner.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/composite_16075350903665-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-05-20-at-9.55.23-PM-678x53.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/composite_16081541094737-678x381.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/JoshSarahLiar-326x245.jpg', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21443277_810770119094955_182111978_n-326x245.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0f8dc5cbdc732a6e9bdb39a00bb71db8?s=125&d=mm&r=g', 'https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/opiniontag-800x100.jpg']",https://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HillaryHumaDumpster.jpg,[],"['About That Conservative Girl', 'Opinion Columnist', 'That Conservative Girl Is A Millennial Living In Southern California On A Small Farm In Cherry Valley.

According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.

Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.

The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.

And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.

And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.

FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.

And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.

Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.

Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.

That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.

We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.

Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?","['https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lisa-page-rats-obama.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Queen-slams-Obama-invictus-game-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MMR-brain-injury-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mandalay-bay-sues-victims-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Netanyahu-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Israeli-snipers-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Putin-gun-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/danish-man-ISIS-fighter-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fingers-health-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MH17-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/1511651_10152594103870715_1942518842_o.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lisa-page-rats-obama-696x393.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flint-empoyees-dead-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CDC-doctor-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Trump-groundwork-vaccinations-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/antifa-terrorist-texas-church-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Golan-heights-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/saudi-arabia-911-lawsuit-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-04-at-7.12.51-PM.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fluoride-post-80x60.png', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FBI-hack-cellphone-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/israel-military-equipment-syria-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mi5-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/illuminati-member-reveals-all-326x245.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/OB-PQ217_india0_H_20110914000557-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lisa-page-rats-obama-678x381.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Texas-war-black-lives-matter-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EU-NATO-merge-superstate-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/China-new-NATO-80x60.jpg', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/trump-bans-milk-soy-80x60.jpg']",https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031im_/https://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lisa-page-rats-obama.jpg,[],[],https://web.archive.org/web/20180719212031/https://yournewswire.com/lisa-page-squeals-dnc-server-not-hacked-russia/,Lisa Page Squeals: DNC Server Was Not Hacked By Russia,[],1531858153.0,https://web.archive.org,
